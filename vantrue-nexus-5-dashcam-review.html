The Vantrue Nexus N5 is the first dashcam we’ve seen with not two, not three, but four cameras.</p><h2 id=why-would-you-need-a-4-channel-dashcam>Why Would You Need a 4-Channel Dashcam?</h2><p>Most people require a dashcam that points forward at traffic in the same lane; typically, the next lane is also covered. Some require a dashcam that monitors activity out of the back of the vehicle. This is useful for rear-end collisions, parking incidents, and the like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Increasingly, we’re seeing dashcams with an interior camera as well. Vantrue has been doing this for a few years and recently released the Nexus 4 with a single internal camera. Elsewhere, <a href=#>we’ve reviewed the Viofo A139 Pro</a>, which also featured an internal camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-connect.JPG><p>One shortcoming of multichannel setups for dashcams is that each peripheral camera reduces the available space on the dashcam’s storage. While loop recordings mean you'll technically never run out of space, regularly recording footage from multiple cameras can hasten the inevitable corruption of the card. Consequently, regular review and reformatting of SD cards is necessary for dashcam owners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Vantrue Nexus 5 features an incredible four cameras. One faces the road ahead, with a companion lens focusing on the driver and front passenger. Anyone behind should also be in shot. A third camera observes the road behind, while its companion is focused on the back of everyone’s heads. Vantrue isn't the only dashcam manufacturer with four-channel units; it's a dynamic that has been around a few years now, but struggled to really gain any momentum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-view.JPG><p>But, why would you need this? Is Vantrue keen to help drivers manage baldness? The only logical response for this fourth channel is for Uber drivers, taxis, and Hackney carriages. Family cars don’t require the fourth camera—it is fixed to the rear unit, so cannot be intelligently positioned—so it really does seem like a feature that's useful for vehicle hire operators only.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>My vehicle is an MPV (seven seats) and as such ideal for reviewing a dashcam with four cameras.</p><h2 id=vantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-features>Vantrue Nexus 5 Dashcam Features</h2><p>The Vantrue Nexus 5 is visually similar (if not identical) to the N4. When I <a href=#>reviewed the Vantrue Nexus 4</a> it seemed that while the dashcam produced great results in 4K, the build quality was concerning.</p><p>Fortunately there is no such issue with this unit.</p><p>The Vantrue Nexus 5 boasts SuperHD recording (essentially 2K on one camera, 1080p on the others), with a maximum 1944P+1080P+1080P+1080P resolution, all @30fps. In the same order, the field of view (FOV) is 158+160+160+165 degrees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-buttons.JPG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Night driving is covered by infrared night vision, and the front unit cameras have WDR (Wide Definition Range). Both the interior cameras have IR LED lights, while the rear camera unit has HDR (high definition range) on both interior and exterior. The main unit features built-in Wi-Fi (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz), and speed can be logged thanks to the GPS mount.</p><p>Beneath the 3.19-inch IPS display is a row of buttons, which are used for configuring the device. While these provide access to menus controlling most of the dashcam’s features, setting things up via the mobile device is easier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-front2.JPG><p>Automatic event recording is initiated when the central unit’s G-sensor is triggered. The device records to a locked portion of the microSD card at this point. This directory will not be overwritten until it's filled (it reserves about one-third of the SD card’s volume).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the mobile app linked, you can set a custom motion detection area and manage every other aspect of the cameras. The N5 also includes a hands-free voice control system and 24/7 parking mode. Buying the dashcam also gives you an 18-month warranty, although, in my experience, Vantrue cameras tend to last longer than those from other manufacturers.</p><h2 id=unpacking-and-installing-the-vantrue-nexus-5>Unpacking and Installing the Vantrue Nexus 5</h2><p>Shipping in the typical Vantrue packaging, the Nexus 5 we received for review included the main dual-camera unit, the rear dual-camera satellite device (with a useful guide for correct placement attached), a quick start guide, and a multilingual manual (English, German, French, and Polish).</p><p>Also included is a GPS mount for the front camera unit, a USB Type-C car charger with a cable measuring 11.5 feet, a 20-foot rear camera USB Type-C cable, a shorter 3-foot USB Type-C cable for data transfer, and plastic crowbar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, there are two electrostatic stickers, two windshield cleaning cloths, a lint-free cloth, two 3M stickers, and warning stickers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-usb.JPG><p>Unfortunately, no SD card was included.</p><p>This kit can also include a CPL filter and a wireless remote control as optional extras. Similarly, a hardwire kit and microSD card are also available. None of these were provided with the review device, though.</p><p>Installing the Vantrue Nexus 5 is straightforward enough if you need single/two-channel mode. With the additional cameras comes more cable routing, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-rear.JPG><p>Note that this dashcam does not ship with adhesive hooks for keeping the cables tidy. It’s been several years since I’ve seen a dashcam kit come with these, and while they can be picked up on eBay or Amazon for a few dollars, their omission is always frustrating.</p><h2 id=dashcam-setup-and-positioning-considerations>Dashcam Setup and Positioning Considerations</h2><p>With smaller, individual camera units, it is simpler to position your dashcams. Due to the Vantrue Nexus 5 kit featuring two dual camera units, things get a little tricky.</p><p>While both mounts feature adjustable ball joints, you still need to be careful where the cameras are mounted. For example, mounting the rear camera correctly is just as important as ensuring the internal view is unimpeded. At the same time, the rear-facing view should be similarly obstruction-free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-app-int-front.JPG><p>Although the vertical angle of the rear unit cameras can be adjusted independently, the horizontal cannot. Adjust left or right, and the other camera is similarly affected. This is an issue that affects the front-mounted cameras, too.</p><p>While the viewing angle of the cameras should cover all eventualities, it’s crucial with a four-channel dashcam setup to ensure positioning is settled before you start driving.</p><p>If you’re upgrading from a previous Vantrue system, you will need to swap the old cabling for the new. While it might seem like you’ll save time, the 6-meter cable is specifically designed for the rear-mounted two-channel unit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-you-talk-to-the-vantrue-nexus-5>Can You Talk to the Vantrue Nexus 5?</h2><p>As well as providing considerable exterior video coverage for your vehicle, this dashcam features voice commands. Capable of detecting phrases in English, Japanese, Russian, and Chinese, the feature lets you enable and disable Wi-Fi, start video recording, take a photo, and do other basic tasks.</p><p>Given the size of the buttons on the device, and its small display, the voice command feature is most useful for enabling and disabling Wi-Fi.</p><p>Response from this system is good, although I prefer having a button to press for emergency recording.</p><h2 id=reviewing-footage-and-gps-information-with-the-vantrue-apps>Reviewing Footage and GPS Information With the Vantrue Apps</h2><p>Viewing footage on the dashcam is better when a different app is used. While the IPS display will relate footage from all four cameras, the screen is tiny. It will show all four camera views while driving, but the 3.19-inch monitor isn’t really up to the task.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-app-rear.JPG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As noted above, the mobile app aids with setup, management, and reviewing footage. It’s not the only way to do it – there is an excellent desktop app for Windows and macOS—but it does the job if you’re out and about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-app-front.JPG><p>I prefer the desktop app, which reads the GPS data stored on the SD card and is paired with the corresponding footage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-fi2.JPG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the mobile option is perfectly good too, and once the footage is downloaded from the Vantrue Nexus 5, you can share it as required.</p><h2 id=does-the-vantrue-nexus-5-fulfill-your-dashcam-needs>Does the Vantrue Nexus 5 Fulfill Your Dashcam Needs?</h2><p>With a large main unit and striking similarities to the N4 Pro, the Vantrue Nexus 5 might lack the 4K footage of the other model, but makes up for it in total coverage.</p><p>Of course, there is little to be gained by monitoring your own family in the back of an SUV or larger vehicle. But if you drive an Uber or other vehicle-for-hire, or manage transport for a small organization (school, college, outdoor center, etc.) then a four-channel dashcam suddenly makes sense.</p><p>Installation can be tedious, especially if this is your first dashcam, but the Vantrue N5 is easy to set up and provides considerable coverage of your car, inside and outside, with at least 1080p resolution. Yes, it's big, but it's also very user-friendly.</p><p>If your existing dashcam doesn’t provide adequate resolution or channels, this could be the upgrade you’re looking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/muo-reviews-vantruen5-fi2.JPG><h5 class=display-card-title>Vantrue N5</h5>8.5<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>If the Vantrue Nexus 5 (N5) four-channel dashcam is on your list of possible purchases, you can expect a bulky—if reliable—dashcam that records in 2K and 1080p.<br>It is accompanied by a reliable mobile app and desktop companion software, which display GPS data alongside video footage.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Vantrue</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGitmqakp8Kmec2er66rXWp6pa3SoZqapV2nsre1xLBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvantrue-nexus-5-dashcam-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./koko-london-gig-venue-guide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./koko-london-gig-venue-guide.html>The gig venue guide: Koko, London | Music</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./serum-foundation.html>Multitasking Formulas For Each Skin Type</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./serum-foundation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
