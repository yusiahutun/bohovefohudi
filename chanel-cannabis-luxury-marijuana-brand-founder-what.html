He is elegant, highly educated and speaks fluent Italian – courtesy of the several years he worked with Dolce & Gabbana in Milan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has degrees in economics and finance from the University of California Davis and UC Berkeley, and is the former president of luxury e-tailer YOOX, which went on to buy Net-a-Porter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/31/03aaeffe-7dcd-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_1320x770_095026.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Somehow, a premium cannabis brand was a natural extension of that. “I love the plant, I love the industry, and I love everything about it,” Kwan says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And the true intention isn’t the love of the plant, though. It’s to further the industry. To shake the stigma, and to make a difference.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On first sight, Beboe could pass for a prestige beauty brand, with its pretty packaging in teal, jade and copper. Do not expect to find roughly rolled blunts or obvious bongs; Beboe fans gracefully inhale micro doses of cannabis from slender rose-gold pens or nibble on lavender-scented pastilles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/31/f2f64abe-7dcc-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_095026.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand – named after the grandmother of Kwan’s business partner, celebrity tattoo artist Scott Campbell – is so steeped in elegance that in March, Beboe joined a clutch of upscale cannabis-related brands in a section called the High End, in Barneys New York’s Beverly Hills store.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beboe is well placed to take advantage of the increasingly relaxed rules around the sale and consumption of cannabis; in 2018, California legalised the sale of recreational marijuana (it has been legal for medical use for a couple of decades).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, anyone 21 or older can pop into any number of stores and dispensaries to buy it – although laws mandate that the product cannot cross state lines.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Black market strong as Canada cannabis shops fail to meet demand</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan concedes that getting over the stigma surrounding cannabis has had its challenges – users are generally regarded as pot-heads and stoners, people who contribute nothing to society. Novices are scared to try it because of the negativity surrounding it. Kwan and Campbell are out to change these notions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The industry used to be about high potency and low prices. With Beboe, we wanted lower doses that are more expensive and have it be quite bourgeois,” says Kwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we started telling people our idea, they were like, ‘get out of here’. But then we started getting calls from dispensaries, saying ‘there’s a lady here with a Celine bag and I don’t know what to sell her.’ I said, ‘give her Beboe’.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">When we started telling people our idea, they were like, ‘get out of here’. But then we started getting calls from dispensaries, saying ‘there’s a lady here with a Celine bag and I don’t know what to sell her.’ I said, ‘give her Beboe’.Clement Kwan</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan says he “grew up poor”, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the son of immigrants from Hong Kong who lived in the Chinese-centric suburb of Monterey Park.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His grandfather was the maitre d’ at the long-defunct Trader Vic’s restaurant at the Beverly Hilton, and his father served as the valet attendant there. He says he and his brother were raised to be a “doctor, lawyer, banker” by his “very Chinese mother”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My brother fulfilled that for the both of us,” says Kwan, whose sibling is in real estate private equity. &nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese blockchain investor lays out a new bet on industrial cannabis</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was in tech and in fashion and my mother didn’t know what that meant and she asked me a lot of crazy questions. I was in banking and I met [Theory Inc CEO] Andrew Rosen, who looked at me and said, ‘You shouldn’t be a banker, you should be in fashion’. He put me in the showroom bringing lunch to retailers and I thought my life was over, that I’d given up being a banker to slave in the fashion business.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, his years in fashion – particularly in Milan – shaped his aesthetic, which in turn eventually yielded Beboe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I learned a lot about what fashion really is, about details and aesthetic. Mr Armani was walking around, it’s the home of Miuccia Prada. It was a beautiful experience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he met Campbell in 2014, the two “bonded over marijuana and our desire to do something in this space. We wanted to give people something that was prettier looking and of the utmost quality, that people in the fashion industry who were discerning consumers would want.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I said to Scott, ‘Hey, this is my background’. We’d both cultivated the plant. We both had experience in luxury. We put it all together and Beboe was born.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Before I went into labour, I smoked a big joint’: Canadian mum</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The line is about 30 per cent more expensive than more conventional cannabis products; the vape pen, for example yields 100 to 120 puffs and retails for US$75. The pastilles are great at dinner parties and as gifts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand recently launched a skincare offering, a face serum and sheet masks; these contain just CBD (cannabidiol) and not the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) that is also a component of the cannabis plant and the thing that, well, gets you high.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The skin offerings, as well as the Beboe “Calming” blend pen, have none of the funny stuff, so you can buy, use and travel with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/31/3721a5bc-7dcd-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_095026.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Which brings Kwan back to what he says he spends much of his time doing these days – educating people about the healing properties of marijuana, and what they can and cannot legally do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The subject has a legacy of myths, that it’s a gateway to other drugs, and that’s all because there is a lack of research and resources,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beboe is working closely with UCLA’s Cannabis Research Initiative, which was founded last year, and is one of the pioneering programmes in the world in studying the plant and its effects on the human body.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Cannabis-extract CBD oil is taking the beauty world by storm</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We hear stories all the time, how people use it for pain or anxiety or to sleep better, and everyone reacts differently to it, and to each different strain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But we market Beboe for fun. You may or may not have an ailment, but it’s really to bring some joy into life. And that itself is a blessing.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: luxury cannabis brand puts a spin on high finance</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmloa2plZXyktMCnnKVlk5a7r63BoqpmpKWtwrPFjKaYq6Gaqq6vrYybqZqmlGKzsMHNnZyrZaedrrU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchanel-cannabis-luxury-marijuana-brand-founder-what.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./buck-rogers-star-erin-gray-reveals-the-shows-impact-on-her-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./buck-rogers-star-erin-gray-reveals-the-shows-impact-on-her-life.html>'Buck Rogers' Star Erin Gray Reveals the Show's Impact on Her Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./452720-mattea-roachs-bio-partner-parents-tattoos-teeth-career-nationality.html>Mattea Roach's bio: partner, parents, tattoos, teeth, career, nationality</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./452720-mattea-roachs-bio-partner-parents-tattoos-teeth-career-nationality.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
