The question is not entirely inappropriate after being seen kissing a guy in the TV series Shades of Blue. It was the first time he kissed a guy on the set while playing the role of a bisexual policeman. But it was also the first time he kissed a man in his life because he is neither gay nor bisexual. In fact, after playing the part the actor said he found it rather strange. It is as if he had said that he had no prejudice against homosexuals.</p><p>That said Liotta has had more relationships in his life than many would have done in two lives.
