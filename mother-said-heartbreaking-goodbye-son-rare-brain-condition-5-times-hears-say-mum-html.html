requires urgent treatment in hospital.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Encephalitis sometimes starts off with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and headache.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More serious symptoms come on over hours, days or weeks, including confusion or disorientation,&nbsp;seizures or fits,&nbsp;changes in personality and behaviour,&nbsp;difficulty speaking, weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body and&nbsp;loss of consciousness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by viral infections, a problem with the immune system or bacterial or fungal infections.</p><p
