However, her parents, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kenneth and Karen Agudong</a>, are from Wailua, a different town in Hawaii.

However, she has pursued other interests while acting. Some of her career highlights include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/071d80b0f1033cfc.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Erin Siena Jobs — Steve Jobs' second oldest daughter</span></p></a><h3>Siena Agudong acting career</h3><p class=align-left>Agudong is one of the most talented young actresses in the <a href=#>world</a>. Even though her acting career is less than ten years, the Hawaii-born actress did not start taking roles in big-budget TV shows and movies. Some of Siena Agudong movies and tv shows include:</p><h4>Acting in theatres</h4><p class=align-left>Unlike most parts of the USA, Hawaii has a thriving theatre culture. So, when she turned seven, her parents took her to Hawaii Children’s Theatre. Even though she was young and inexperienced compared to other actors, she got some impressive roles.</p><p class=align-left>However, her most significant role at the theatre was playing the famous Willy Wonka. In several interviews, Agudong has confessed that the role was proof that she has a talent.</p><h4>As Mindy is 2013’s Second Chances</h4><p class=align-left>After acting in the theatre for a year, the talented TV star transitioned to the mainstream scene in 2013. The creators of Second Chances auditioned her for Mindy, a supporting character. Thanks to her background in acting, she was one of the most memorable characters in the movie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1eb6c40b30c0decd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Khalyla Kuhn: Bobby Lee relationship, family, ethnicity, career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even though the movie is not one of the best selling among the ones she has been part of the casting, it gave her a soft landing in the competitive movie space. However, she did not take another role in movies until 2018.</p><h4>As Sophia Miller in Star Falls</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fd87c47c2b22363.jpg><p class=align-left>Agudong played Sophia Miller, the main actress in 2018’s Star Falls. Even though the comedy’s show received low reviews IMDb, it was one of the most-watched shows on Nickelodeon and TeenNick in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to her impressive performance on the show, she was nominated in 2019’s Best Young Ensemble. The nomination also gave her the needed visibility as she transitioned to a young adult space.</p><h4>As Natalie in Nicky, Ricky, D*cky & Dawn</h4><p class=align-left>From 2014 to 2018, the TV star played Natalie in Nicky, Ricky, D*cky & Dawn, one of the best children’s sitcoms. Although she was not the main character, Agudong was one of the most interesting supporting characters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5e44049a92e0e36c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Destiny Etiko biography: Husband, children, parents, net worth, house, movies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thanks to her brilliant performance, she received numerous nominations in the Young Entertainer Awards. Fortunately, she won the 2017 Best Guest Starring Young Actress (12 years and Younger).</p><h4>As Nick in 2019’s No Good Nick</h4><p class=align-left>The Hawaii-native was part of No Good Nick cast as the main character. Even though Star Falls was her first lead role, playing Nick was her first role on a Netflix-owned production.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>Netflix</a> Sitcom was instrumental to her in two ways. First, she worked with some of the best creators, such as Keetgi Kogan and David H. Steinberg. Second, the show enjoyed one of the highest viewerships, thanks to Netflix’s huge market share in the streaming space.</p><h3>As a soccer player</h3><p class=align-left>Besides being brilliant on Alex & Me, Agudong has unmatched soccer skills on the set. Interestingly, she has played soccer before. Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Week99er</a>, the TV star confessed her love for soccer. Before she started getting roles in big TV series, Agudong trained with different teams in Hawaii.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/24d4a6f62e29c176.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chika Ike bio: Age, husband, children, net worth, and facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, she has never played in any league games. The main reason, according to her, is the unpredictable shooting schedule. Unlike most occupations, playing soccer for a team requires more than talent. She is currently concentrating on acting, but she may consider playing soccer in the future.</p><h3>As a model</h3><p class=align-left>The TV star is a model and fashion enthusiast. Siena Agudong height makes her a perfect model for specific brands. Also, her visibility and celebrity status makes her an ideal beauty icon.</p><p class=align-left>Siena Agudong has appeared on different magazine covers in the past five years. While most publications are related to her films and TV shows, she is undeniably a talented model. For example, she was on the cover of PhotoBook Magazine in August 2020.</p><p class=align-left>Like other movies/TV stars, she is more likely to venture into the fashion industry soon. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Everly Mag</a>, she confessed her love for fashion and beauty. Currently, all her modelling gigs are through Slash Agency.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e07255d744a3173c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tik Tok's Avani Gregg ethnicity, nationality, parents and siblings</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/071d80b0f1033cfc.png><h3>As an influencer</h3><p class=align-left>Thanks to her massive following on Snapchat and Instagram, Siena Agudong is an influencer. However, her approach to influencing is different from what most celebrities do in the new marketing space. Most of her social media postings are acting related, mainly because she is an actress.</p><p class=align-left>While it is unclear if she can post adverts unrelated to acting, most production companies such as Netflix include bonuses to cast members’ salaries. Based on her Snapchats and Instagram posts, she earns from creating engagements about TV shows and movies.</p><h2>Siena Agudong net worth</h2><p class=align-left>While some entertainment tabloids such as<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Starsgab </a>estimate her net worth to be around $6 million, the TV star has never disclosed her financial status. Details such as her salary and income from endorsements remain one of her closely guarded secrets.</p><p class=align-left>However, most of her income is from acting.
