The star, who is believed to have started the crazy world of <a href=#>celebrity</a>, passed away in the <a href=#>property</a> more than 60 years ago. Despite the historical significance of the home, the new owner has filed for demolition permits. This means the movie star’s famous home could be gone forever.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-marilyn-monroe-s-brentwood-home-faces-demolition>Marilyn Monroe’s Brentwood home faces demolition</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1176299-1024x685.jpg><p>The New York Post <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> the new owner of the Brentwood estate, based in Los Angeles, has sought permission to tear it down.</p><p>The Hacienda-style property, which is one story, recently sold for an unknown sum. However, there are reports it could have changed hands for around $8.3 million.</p><p>The four-bedroom abode was constructed in 1929 and has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. It still holds fine features that were part of the original architectural designs, such as terra-cotta tile floors and beamed ceilings.</p><p>The casement windows, whitewash walls and roof tiling echo the long-forgotten tales of Old Hollywood, which Marilyn Monroe herself embodied.</p><p>The outlet states a “plan check” was given the go-ahead earlier this week from the city’s Department of Building and Safety. This could mean the first stages of the process are charging forward. However, a formal permit for the demolition of the iconic home hasn’t been granted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-only-place-marilyn-monroe-could-ever-really-call-home>Only place Marilyn Monroe could ever really call ‘home’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-131651462-806x1024.jpg><p>The 2,900-square-ft Hollywood property features a citrus orchard, glistening pool, and shrubbery outlining a picturesque lawn.</p><p>Marilyn Monroe bought the home back in 1962, only a mere few months before she was found dead. It was February of that year when she got the keys after handing over $77,000 – which is almost $800,000 in current currency. However, it would only be six months later in August that headlines would read she had died.</p><p>The blonde bombshell was found dead in her bedroom at the young age of 36. An autopsy report later detailed she had passed away following a barbiturate overdose.</p><p>The starlet had moved around a lot in her lifetime, which was full of success, struggle and tragedy. She lived in 43 different places before finally choosing one of her own. It’s believed she made the leap of buying her own place after her psychiatrist advised her to ‘put down some roots’.</p><p>She lived there during some of the most famous final appearances of her life. From singing happy birthday to John F Kennedy to filming her last <a href=#>movie</a> in an attempt of a showbiz comeback. The actor had been cast in Something’s Got To Give, but sadly died before it wrapped. The film itself was never completed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tragic-life-of-hollywood-s-biggest-movie-star>Tragic life of Hollywood’s biggest movie star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-607384406-1024x807.jpg><p>Born to a young mother out of wedlock, Marilyn Monroe was first Norma Jeane Mortenson. She grew up in orphanages and foster homes and had a troubled childhood.</p><p>She married the first time when she was only a teenager, a soldier, and LA officer during the Second World War. The star tied the knot with James Dougherty less than three weeks after her 16th birthday – but it didn’t last.</p><p>She was scouted while working in a factory by a photographer. He had visited to snap inspiring photographs and was drawn in by her. Marilyn then began working as a model before her big break on the Silver Screen with Niagra in 1953.</p><p>Two other films that very year helped push her further into stardom. Playing the type-cast character of a dumb and soft-spoken blonde in Gentleman Prefer Blondes and then How to Marry a Millionaire.</p><p>She married second husband, sport star Joe DiMaggio the following year, but they split less than 9 months later. Then, she exchanged vows with playwright Arthur Miller in 1956. They first met in 1950 after a mutual friend introduced them on set. However, nothing happened between them, and they reconnected after she left DiMaggio. The pair were together for five years before breaking up for good a year before her death.</p><p>Hollywood then lost one of their icons on August 5, 1962. She was found lying on her bed face down with her telephone in one hand. Empty bottles of pills – which were prescribed to treat her <a href=#>depression</a> who later psychiatrists have reported could have been bipolar disorder – were found nearby. Her tragic death at a young age was deemed suicide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-speak-to-someone>Speak to someone</h2><p>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
