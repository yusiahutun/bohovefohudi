I wanted to tell the truth, I wanted to set the record straight. Naïvely, I thought if I put my own feelings and my own truth out there for the world to read, my family might also come to understand me better." Davis added by saying, "During the early stages of my father’s Alzheimer’s, when he still had lucid moments, I apologized to him for writing an autobiography many years earlier in which I flung open the gates of our troubled family life. He was already talking less at that point, but his eyes told me he understood."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'It was terrifying': Prince Harry says William 'screamed and shouted' at him after he announced exit</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Prince Harry's memoir gets a release date as he rushes to WATER DOWN bombshell book</a></p><h2 class=split>Advice for Prince Harry</h2><p>"I thought of that moment when I read that Prince Harry, in his new memoir, wrote about his father, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, getting between his battling sons and saying, ‘Please, boys, don’t make my final years a misery.’ Time is an unpredictable thing…I had the gift of time with my father, which allowed me to apologize, even though a disease hovered between us and clouded our communication. King Charles’s words reveal a man who is aware of his mortality and who would like his offspring to be aware of it as well," she said, who further explained there are multiple versions of the truth. "People generally don’t respond well to being embarrassed and exposed in public. And in the ensuing years, I’ve learned something about the truth: It’s way more complicated than it seems when we’re young. There isn’t just one truth, our truth — the other people who inhabit our story have their truths as well," Davis expressed, as quoted by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox News.</a></p><h2 class=split>'William's truth has to be considered as well'</h2><p>Talking about the physical altercation between Harry and Prince William in 2019, Davis said, "Prince William has, I’m sure, his own take on the physical fight that Harry has described. To really understand the dynamic between the brothers, to broaden the story, and make it more complete, William’s truth has to be considered as well. Harry has written that, after William hit him, William told Harry to hit him back, which he declined to do. But by writing about the fight, he’s done exactly that."</p><h2 class=split>'Harry chose words that cut deep'</h2><p>Explaining herself for exposing the secrets of her family, she said, "Years ago, someone asked me what I would say to my younger self if I could. Without hesitating I answered: ‘That’s easy. I’d have said, "Be quiet."’ Not forever. But until I could stand back and look at things through a wider lens. Until I understood that words have consequences, and they last a really long time. Harry has called William not only his ‘beloved brother’ but his ‘arch nemesis.’ He chose words that cut deep, that leave a scar; perhaps if he had taken time to be quiet, to reflect on the enduring power of his words, he’d have chosen differently. Silence gives you room, it gives you distance, and it lets you look at your experiences more completely, without the temptation to even the score. Sometime in the years ahead, Harry may look back as I did and wish he could unspeak what he has said. I’ve learned something else about truth: Not every truth has to be told to the entire world."</p><h2 class=split>Who is Patti Davis?</h2><p>Born on October 21, 1952, in Los Angeles, California, Davis is an actress, author, activist, and Alzheimer’s advocate, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Kensington White Plains.</a> In 1984, she married her yoga instructor Paul Grilley, however, they got divorced after six years in 1990, states <a href=# rel=nofollow>IMDb.</a> She now publishes columns and articles in a number of newspapers and magazines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqp%2Bjrq2wjKucoJmeqHqlrdSgn62domK9osDTomSdmaaewG7DwKulrGWgp7avr8Rmn5qqoq56rq3YZqmen6KawW7D0aKroqaXYsCxrdGe</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sunshine-kiki-brown-and-clayne-crawford.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sunshine-kiki-brown-and-clayne-crawford.html>Sunshine Kiki Brown and Clayne Crawford</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./restaurant-news.html>Life Is Sweet</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./restaurant-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
