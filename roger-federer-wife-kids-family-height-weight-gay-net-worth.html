He is a professional tennis player from Switzerland who has dominated the world of sport for many years and has thus set many records in men’s tennis and in the tennis world as a whole. With over 95 titles to his name and more to come.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Roger Federer Wife, Kids, Family, Height, Weight, Gay, Net Worth</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Roger Federer Biography</strong></h2><p>Roger Federer was born on 8 August 1981 in the Swiss city of Basel. He is of Swiss, German, and South African descent and was raised by his parents together with his older sister.</p><p>Roger is good in more than five languages, having grown up in Riehen as well as near the French and German borders, in Münchenstein.</p><p>Because of his love of the game, which he started playing as a child, the tennis player served as a ball boy while he was still growing. Interestingly, it is the sport with which he was to rule the world many years later.</p><p>In 1998 he became a professional and played in this game as a junior. His beginning was spectacular, but not enough to serve as proof of who he would become because while he finished first in the junior world rankings, he did not win the US Open Junior Final. More than that, he lost his first professional tournament without making it past the first round.</p><p>He would continue to enjoy great success, but it would not be until 2003 that he defeated Mark Philippoussis and took home the Grand Slam singles title, which would be his first at Wimbledon. In 2004, he would not let up and won 3 Grand Slams, leading the rankings for the first time.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Novak Djokovic Wife, Son, Affair, Height, Weight, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>Before mid-2018 he would win 8 Wimbledon, 6 Australian Opens, 5 US Opens, and one French Open. He would also have won almost 100 titles.</p><p>At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, he played alongside Stan Wawrinka to take home the gold medal in the men’s doubles. 4 years later in London, he won the silver medal after losing to Andy Murray at the 2012 Olympics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Roger Federer&nbsp;</strong><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>As already mentioned, there is hardly any argument for Roger Federer being the best tennis player ever. What’s more, he has excelled among the world’s highest-paid athletes in 2017 and ranks 23rd among the world’s highest-paid celebrities. The only athletes on the list who have earned more than him this year are Lionel Messi, LeBron James, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who heads all the athletes on the list.</p><p>Although he earned up to 64 million dollars this year, Roger Federer’s net worth is estimated at 420 million dollars as of 204 (304 million pounds).</p><p>Of his winnings, Federer has recorded more than $58 million from endorsements – $6 million from his endorsements in 2017 alone, and more than $100 million in prize money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family</strong></h2><p>Roger Federer comes from a very simple family and they happen to be very close. His father, Robert Federer, is a very popular face in his son’s games and he said he was very proud of him. His mother, Lynette Federer, is also a popular face in his games. She is originally a South African woman from Gauteng.</p><p>One family member who has remained in the dark is the star’s only sister, who is said to be a nurse in Switzerland, Diana Federer. She is Roger’s older sister and is married and has children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is He Married Or Gay? Wife, Kids</strong></h2><p>While some have always wondered about Roger’s sexual orientation and whether he is gay or not, the truth is that he is heterosexual. Not only that but he has also been married since 2009.</p><p>His wife is Mirka Federer. Born in 1978 in Czechoslovakia as Miroslava Vavrincová, Mirka was like her husband, a tennis player who became a professional in 1998 and had to retire in 2002 due to injuries.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kevin Anderson Wife, Height, Age, Net Worth, Biography</a></strong></p><p>Mirka Federer and Roger met in 2000, and it was not long before they decided on 11 April 2009 that it was time to close the deal for life at the Villa Wenkenhof near Basel. Their union has so far been blessed with two pairs of twins: Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, born in 2009, and Leo and Lennart, born in 2014.</p><p>Today the legendary tennis player Mirka Federer lives with her children in the community of Bottmingen in Switzerland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Weight</strong></h2><p>A Swiss tennis player is a man who has become one with the sport thanks to his ability to hold the game, which is a testament to his stamina and agility. He has a good height and is of average build.</p><p>Roger Federer stands at a height of 183 cm (6 feet 1 inch) and a weight of 85 kg (187 pounds). As for his general measurements, his chest measures 44 inches (112 cm) and his waist 32 inches (81 cm), while he wears a shoe size of 12 (USA) or 45 (EU).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kv7CzxKtkn52Umr%2BmvoywoJ%2BdXaC2pb%2BMn5imoZyueqmxyKCfrWWnmraotNNmnpqxXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froger-federer-wife-kids-family-height-weight-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./65370521e2704e231d8b458e-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./65370521e2704e231d8b458e-html.html>Segundo eliminado de Quin es la Mscara 2023: personajes y quin es Girasol</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jackie-miller-james-coma-pregnant-influencer.html>Pregnant Influencer In Medically Induced Coma After Suffering Aneurysm Week Before Due Date</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jackie-miller-james-coma-pregnant-influencer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
