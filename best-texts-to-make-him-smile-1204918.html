If you are away from your partner and are missing him, you can send texts to make him smile and get a conversation rolling! Not only will such text messages leave him beaming and starry-eyed, but they will also make him feel good about himself. Moreover, texting is a simple way to assure him that he is on your mind, no matter the distance between the two of you. The right message at the right time can also get his attention back to you and help keep the spark in your relationship alive.&nbsp;</p><p>According to clinical psychologist, Dr. Samar Hafeez, “Remote romance can thrive with the help of the right mindset and right partner, as the accessibility and popularity of electronic media are at its pinnacle, couples are easily able to keep in touch with each other via text messages and video calls. Having fun with the partner, intentional communication, and quality of conversation matter the most when you are away from your loved one.”</p><p>However, texting a guy can, at times, be tricky because you want to avoid coming off as too needy or desperate. But, fret not. The best text messages for this purpose are those that are funny, romantic, flirty, sweet, or just plain cute. From "I love you more than anything in the world" to "I miss your handsome face already", there are a wide variety of texts that you can send to make your guy's day undoubtedly better than how it is already going!
