Protein is vital for building and repairing cells, including muscles, and women, especially those who eat a plant-based diet exclusively, should boost their protein with a supplement. Eating too little protein might mean you’re not getting the essential amino acids required to maintain a properly functioning body. Without an adequate amount of protein, you may suffer from a slower metabolism, weaker immune system, brittle nails, hair loss, or exhaustion. While it can’t replace fresh foods with high levels of protein, like spinach and lentils, vegan protein powders can be a great addition to your diet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is a vegan diet dangerous?</h2><p>A vegan lifestyle is healthy as long as you ensure you are getting all the proper nutrients you need. Thankfully, plant-based protein is comparable to the kind that comes from animals. In fact, a study done by the American Dietetic Association found that plant foods can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">provide all essential amino acids</a> and help with the same functions as meat-based proteins. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Research</a> also shows that plant protein may be healthier for a variety of reasons. Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University and a leader in nutritional research, found in his studies that animal-based proteins may throw off your body’s pH levels. Without a balanced pH, your body has to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pull extra calcium</a> out to help alkalize it, which can weaken your bones and deplete your minerals.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is vegan protein powder good for you?</h2><p>Now that we know what vegan protein is, here’s the real question — is it good for you? According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dr. Sarah Cimperman</a>, a New York <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">naturopathic doctor</a>, the answer is yes. By closely reading labels and making sure to include anything missing from your diet, thus offsetting your chances of deficiencies. you may find a vegan protein powder can make a world of a difference in your overall health.&nbsp;</p><p>“When it comes to my vegan patients, I’m most concerned that they get enough protein, omega-3 essential fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin A, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">iron</a>, zinc, selenium, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinol. When it comes to vegan protein powders, I recommend looking for products that contain these nutrients,” she tells FIRST. “I also recommend avoiding products that contain additives. Supplementing a whole foods vegan diet with protein powder is a good way to get more of what the body needs.” (For more healthy tips and recipes, visit Dr. Cimperman’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blog</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/vegan-protein-for-women.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Protein Powder Nutrition: What vegan protein powder is best?</h2><p>When it’s time to choose a protein powder, look closely to see what other vitamins, minerals, and additives it includes to find the best one for you.
