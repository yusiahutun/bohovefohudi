<time>26 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Even though he’s a major box-office draw and known all over the globe, Keanu Reeves has stayed true to the young man he was before he hit it big in Hollywood.</p><p>“In this often unkind and shallow world, my friend Keanu gives others hope,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie-Ann Moss</a>, his Matrix co-star, wrote of him when Reeves made Time magazine’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">100 Most Influential People of 2022</a> list. “The actions of this handsome, talented, successful, and fiercely committed actor have become a reprieve from the constant disappointment we have for those who get put on a pedestal.”</p><p>Here we take a look at his life, career and find out why he is one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1240448128.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keanu Reeves young years</h2><p>Reeves, now 59, was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and spent time living in Sydney and New York before settling down with his mom, a costume designer, in Toronto.</p><p>The actor, who is of Chinese, English, Irish, Native Hawaiian and Portuguese descent, grew up a “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty private kid</a>,” he once told Rolling Stone, though he added he was “pretty social, too.”</p><p>Despite suffering from dyslexia, he started to act around age 15, performing in Shakespearean scenes in school. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I think my Mercurio was pretty good,</a>” he joked to Esquire, and though he never finished high school, he was always a hard worker who was fiercely motivated to succeed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/1.jpg><p>“Even when I was a kid. ‘Let’s go make something!’ ‘Let’s do something!’ ‘Yeah!’” was Reeves’ attitude, he explained, and he started grinding away to realize his dream of being in movies, attending <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uta Hagen’s</a> famous Respect for Acting class at night, taking improv classes at Toronto’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Second City</a> and even driving to New York for additional training.</p><p>Spoiler alert! He became a huge star, winning 1992’s Most Desirable Male at the MTV Video Music Awards, CinemaCon’s 2016 Vanguard Award and more. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German scientists even named a fungi-killing compounds (keanumycin) after him in 2023</a>, in honor of his butt-kicking characters in The Matrix and John Wick franchises. If that doesn’t solidify your star power, nothing will!</p><p>Still, the actor remains humble. “I mean, I’ve been a part of some films that are… good. You know, the directors, the scripts. All those films kind of change your life,” Reeves told Esquire of his resume, which most others in Hollywood would kill to have.</p><p>Read on to track Reeves’ diverse range of roles throughout his impressive five-decade career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Young Keanu Reeves in the 80s</h2><p>As a teen, Reeves was a talented athlete who also had dreams of playing hockey in the Olympics (remember: Canada!). In 1983, he got to enjoy the sweet taste of victory (both literally and figuratively) by appearing in a Coca-Cola commercial as a race-winning bicyclist.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The following year, he hammed it up on the Canadian TV series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hangin’ In</a>. Come 1985, he’d landed a role as a troubled kid in <a href=#>One Step </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Away</a>, a Canadian short film. He also served as a teen correspondent on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Going Great</a>, a Canadian newsmagazine program.</p><p>Then things really started to heat up for Reeves in 1986. His debut feature film, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Youngblood</a>, came out, and he got to lace up his skates for the ice hockey drama that co-starred <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Lowe </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Swayze</a>.</p><p>Two other films that year fittingly had youthful themes and titles: He appeared as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Urich’s</a> teenage incarnation in the fantasy-romance movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Again</a>, opposite Lindsay Wagner. “It sounds like I won something in a game show: ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We flew you to Los Angeles!’</a>” he joked to a young reporter at the time about his acting dreams coming true. “I’m playing a 17-year-old body with a 40-year-old mind,” he added of that particular project’s challenges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/babes-in-toyland_2iymoz.jpg><p>Next he played Jack Be Nimble in the Christmas themed TV movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Babes in Toyland</a>, starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew Barrymore</a>. Earlier that year, he also appeared with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiefer Sutherland</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Zane</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lori Loughlin</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brotherhood of Justice</a>, as well as with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dennis Hopper</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ione Skye</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">River’s Edge</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/3-25.jpg><p>He’d re-team with Loughlin in 1988’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Night Before</a>, and that year’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dangerous Liaisons</a> put him the A-list company of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenn Close</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Malkovich</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uma Thurman</a>.</p><p>In 1989, he stepped into the time-traveling shoes of one of his most memorable characters: Ted in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure</a>. Party on, dude! And Reeves did, also appearing that year in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ron Howard</a>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parenthood</a>, starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Martin</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dianne Wiest</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joaquin Phoenix</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/bill-teds-excellent-adventure_xOXa8d.jpg><p>He then got to channel the spirit of Rebel Without a Cause’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Dean</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paula Abdul</a>’s video for her No. 1 hit “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rush Rush</a>.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keanu takes on the 90s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/Copy-of-then-and-now-1.jpg><p>In 1991, Reeves got time-trippy again in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey</a>, then also portrayed a street hustler alongside his close friend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">River Phoenix</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Own Private Idaho</a>. (“I miss him dearly. F—ing sucks. I know so many people miss him dearly,” Reeves said after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix’s shocking death</a> two years later at just 23). Reeves made a big splash as surfer Johnny Utah in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Point Break</a>, opposite Patrick Swayze, and he also formed his rock band <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogstar</a> (for which he plays bass) in 1991, too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Swayze Movies: Celebrating the Charismatic Star’s Most Iconic Roles</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/2-5.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bram Stoker’s Dracula</a> came along in 1992, though critics largely found the film starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Oldman</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Winona Ryder</a> lifeless.

In 2018, Bullock confessed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellen DeGeneres</a> that she had a crush on her magnetic co-star, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reeves appeared on the comedian’s daytime talker</a> a year later to similarly come clean. “She obviously didn’t know I had a crush on her,” he teased.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/4-25.jpg><p>Other highlights from the decade — in which he did a 1995 stint as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamlet</a> onstage at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre in Winnipeg — included 1995’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Mneumonic</a> and the romance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A Walk in the Clouds</a>; 1996’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Feeling Minnesota</a>, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Diaz</a>; and 1997’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Devil’s Advocate</a>, starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Pacino.</a></p><p>Of course, the decade ended on a high note with 1999’s high-octane dystopian classic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Matrix</a>, in which Reeves first introduced moviegoers to computer programmer Neo. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That fall where I jump from the building, that was like a 35-foot wire-jump,</a>” he told Empire about the physically demanding role. “They just had some guys and a machine dropping me upside down. I got good enough to do the front flip and the back flip and the run up the wall.…But I don’t know. In an odd way that was the easy part. It’s finding the interior of the character that’s the challenge.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2000 to 2009</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/5-21.jpg><p>After appearing in the 2000 sports comedy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Replacements</a> with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Hackman</a>, and 2001’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet November</a>, in which he romances — and sings for! — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlize Theron</a>, Reeves returned to his role as Neo for 2003’s one-two punch of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Matrix Reloaded</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Matrix Revolutions</a>. He closed out the year with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Something’s Gotta Give</a>, a lighthearted comedy headlined by legends <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diane Keaton</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Nicholson</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/3-5.jpg><p>He tackled the superhero horror flick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Constantine</a> in 2005, then kicked back a little in 2006’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lake House</a>, a fantasy romance flick with his good pal Sandra Bullock.

In 2014, he debuted another one of his most iconic roles and franchises: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wick</a>. As the former assassin who’s drawn back into some dark and dangerous dealings, Reeves had scored another big hit that grossed $14.4&nbsp;million in its opening weekend. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There’s a character that we root for, hopefully. He’s fighting for his life,</a>” Reeves has told Collider of the franchise’s success. “The films are fun, but they’re smart. There’s humor, and action. Comedy. It has a unique tone, I think. So, you can tell I’m a fan.” As are millions of theatergoers, who flocked to see 2017’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wick: Chapter 2</a>, 2019’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum</a> and 2023’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wick: Chapter 4</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/6-19.jpg><p>When he wasn’t kicking butt in the Wick series throughout the decade, Reeves had a few other notable projects. In 2016, he started appearing as stuntman Tex “Crazy Man” Johnson in the web series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swedish Dicks</a>. And in 2018, he took a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destination Wedding</a> with Winona Ryder, with whom he’d co-starred in three previous films, including Bram Stoker’s Dracula, 2006’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A Scanner Darkly</a> and 2009’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Private Lives of Pippa Lee</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/6-4.jpg><p>In 2019, Reeves got animated and gave voice to Duke Caboom, “Canada’s Greatest Stuntman,” for 2019’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toy Story 4</a>.
