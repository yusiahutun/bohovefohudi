<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The Home Alone 2 cast and crew consists of actors and actresses who worked on the John Hughes-written film. “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” is a 1992 American Christmas comedy directed by Chris Columbus. In addition, it’s the sequel to the 1990 film “Home Alone” and the second film in the franchise.</p><p>The movie received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances while criticizing the darker tone and violence and its similarities to the first film. However, it grossed over $359 million worldwide on a $28 million production budget, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-16_05-14-34-fotor-2023081651830.jpg><p>Home Alone 2 follows Kevin McCallister as he is separated from his family on their vacation in New York City. In the sequel, he has another encounter with the Wet Bandits after their escape during a prison riot. Following its release, Home Alone 2 recorded immense success and is an all-time favorite for many. Consequently, fans are curious about where the Home Alone 2 cast is and what they’ve been up to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Macaulay_Culkin_Kevin_McCallister></span>Macaulay Culkin (Kevin McCallister)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Macaulay Culkin’s leading role as Kevin catapulted the then-10-year-old child star into the spotlight after the classic Christmas film’s release. Following his appearance as one of the Home Alone 2 cast, Culkin landed roles in projects like “The Good Son,” “Richie Rich,” and “Party Monster.”&nbsp;</p><p>He then went on to appear in “Saved!,” “Sex and Breakfast,” “Kings,” “Adam Green’s Aladdin,” and “The Jim Gaffigan Show.” In addition, some of his latest roles include playing Ian in “Changeland” and portraying Mickey in season 10 of “American Horror Story.” Aside from movie appearances, Culkin voiced Downtown Pat in the 2022 animated rom-com “Entergalactic” and hosts a podcast, “Bunny Ears.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-16_05-14-44-fotor-2023081651925.jpg><p>Like his acting career, his personal life has been quite busy too. Although Culkin married Rachel Miner, the two split in 2002. Afterward, he stepped back from the spotlight and began a low-profile relationship with actress Mila Kunis. They dated for eight years until they split in 2011. However, the “Home Alone” star found love again in 2017 with a fellow child star, Brenda Song.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joe_Pesci_Harry_Lime></span>Joe Pesci (Harry Lime)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Pesci is no stranger to playing a criminal, his role in the ’90s hit was more lighthearted than usual. As one of the Home Alone 2 cast, Pesci portrayed Harry, one of the crooks that Kevin prevents from robbing the toy store Duncan’s Toy Chest on Christmas Eve. Following his appearance in the 1992 film, Pesci landed several roles and has appeared in other films.&nbsp;</p><p>He starred in a series of Martin Scorsese’s crime-family sagas alongside Robert De Niro. He appeared in cult classics such as “Goodfellas” (1990), “My Cousin Vinny” (1992), “Casino” (1995), and “Gone Fishin'” (1997). In addition, Pesci appeared in “A Bronx Tale,” “The Good Shepherd,” and “Love Ranch.” However, his last acting credit was taking on the role of Russell Bufalino in Martin Scorsese’s 2019 film, “The Irishman.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Daniel_Stern_Marv_Murchins></span>Daniel Stern (Marv Murchins)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Stern’s character may not have succeeded in stealing from the McCallisters, he has secured a spot in Hollywood since the film’s release. After his role as Marv, Stern continued as narrator on the hit series “The Wonder Years” until its finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-16_05-14-57-fotor-2023081651736.jpg><p>After appearing as a Home Alone 2 cast member, Stern worked steadily in film and TV. Some of his subsequent projects were “Rookie of the Year,” “City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly’s Gold,” “Bushwhacked,” and “Celtic Pride.”&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he has since scored roles like John Whitman in “The Last Time,” Earl Cavendar in “Whip It,” and Glen Babbit in “Manhattan.” He also appeared in Aidy Bryant’s Hulu series “Shrill” and the 2019 film “James vs. His Future Self.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Catherine_OHara_Kate_McCallister></span>Catherine O’Hara (Kate McCallister)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Catherine O’Hara is another Home Alone 2 cast member whose face was already famous in Hollywood. She was already making waves thanks to several supporting roles she played throughout the 1980s. After portraying Kate McCallister, the McCallister family matriarch, O’Hara continued to act in various films and on several TV series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-16_05-15-02-fotor-2023081651659-683x1024.jpg><p>Over the past three decades, <a href=#>O’Hara</a> has remained busy with parts in prominent films and TV shows. She voiced Sally in “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and played Cookie Fleck in “Best in Show.” Afterward, she took on roles in “Penelope,” “Killers,” and “Skylanders Academy,” to name a few.</p><p>In addition, she delighted audiences recently with her hilarious performance as Moira Rose on “Schitt’s Creek,” from 2015 to 2020. Although the show ended in 2020, her stellar performance earned her an Emmy for outstanding lead actress in 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Heard_Peter_McCallister></span>John Heard (Peter McCallister)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After appearing in the Home Alone 2 cast as Kevin’s loving (but forgetful) father in 1992, John Heard starred in several other movies. Consequently, throughout his four-decade Hollywood career, Heard became a well-respected actor and accumulated over 200 big and small screen credits.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-16_05-15-09-fotor-2023081651945.jpg><p>Heard appeared in many well-known films, such as “Gladiator” (1992), “Awakenings” (1990), and “The Guardian” (2006). In addition, he starred in “Law & Order,” “The Sopranos,” “White Chicks,” “CSI: Miami,” and “Jack & Bobby.” Unfortunately, <a href=#>John Heard</a> died in 2017 at the age of 71. One of his final acting roles was playing a police chief in “Imprisoned,” a drama thriller film.</p><p>Like <a href=#>the Enough cast</a>, these actors and the other Home Alone 2 cast and crew contributed to the film’s success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktbC5xGaYpaeemnpzecKaqq1lp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhome-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html>Mckenna Grace Wants People 'Uncomfortable' with Her 14-Year-Old Wife on Handmaid's Tale</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./allison-moorer.html>Allison Moorer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./allison-moorer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
