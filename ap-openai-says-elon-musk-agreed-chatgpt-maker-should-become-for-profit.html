He said in his lawsuit that he invested “tens of millions” of dollars in OpenAI.</p><p>However, the company said that while Musk invested less than $45 million, it has raised more than $90 million from other donors.</p><p>OpenAI said that by 2017, the company leaders started to realize that building artificial general intelligence would take vast amounts of computing power.</p><p>“We all understood we were going to need a lot more capital to succeed at our mission — billions of dollars per year, which was far more than any of us, especially Elon, thought we’d be able to raise as the non-profit,” it said.</p><p>In discussions, OpenAI says Musk demanded to be CEO and majority shareholder and have control of the board but OpenAI executives didn’t think any single person should have “absolute control.”</p><p>Musk then suggested OpenAI could be merged with Tesla so that the electric car maker could act as a “cash cow” to compete with Google’s well-funded AI efforts.</p><p>It didn’t happen, and Musk instead left to build his own artificial general intelligence startup, xAI, while remaining supportive of OpenAI’s plans to raise billions of dollars, the company said.</p><p>OpenAI also pushed back against Musk’s argument that it broke its promise to keep its code open to the public instead of walling it off for private gains.</p><p>It posted an email from chief scientist Ilya Sutskever saying that open sourcing everything lets “someone unscrupulous” build “unsafe AI” and that “it’s totally OK to not share the science.” Musk replied: “Yup.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Technology Writer Matt O’Brien contributed from Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>___</p><p>The AP has signed a deal with OpenAI for it to access its news archive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46brKyhnprAtHvAqWSbraOeu6a%2F0miYqWWfpbKvrchmqpqxo2KyrbvNZqSuq5tirqi%2BxJ6bZpuYlsGovNNmpJqjlad6tLTOrqOdZZKasLC5xGadqKpdpb%2BwssitZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fap-openai-says-elon-musk-agreed-chatgpt-maker-should-become-for-profit.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coronation-streets-harriet-bibbys-glam-26922956.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coronation-streets-harriet-bibbys-glam-26922956.html>Coronation Street's Harriet Bibby's glam snaps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./japan-plane-crash-haneda-airport-japan-airlines-what-happened-cabin-crew-safety-survivors.html>Miracle at Haneda: how cabin crew pulled off great escape from Japan plane fire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./japan-plane-crash-haneda-airport-japan-airlines-what-happened-cabin-crew-safety-survivors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
