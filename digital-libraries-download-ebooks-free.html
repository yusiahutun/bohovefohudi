<time>15 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>With the advance in digital technology, more and more people are choosing ebooks and audiobooks over printed books. Amazon alone offers millions of ebooks in every category you could think of. Some are free, while others come with a hefty price tag.</p><p>The good news is that you can always head over to a digital library to get the information you need when you need it. You just have to know what to look for, and these digital libraries are a great place to start if you want free ebooks, audiobooks, and other online resources.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=open-library>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Library</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-library-history-books.png><p>Open Library started out as an online project designed to preserve interesting websites, ebooks, and other digital assets. Its founders wanted to "create a web page for every book ever published."</p><p>Today, users can "borrow" and read millions of ebooks for free. All you need to do is to sign up for an account and browse the Open Library. You can even add new books to its collection.</p><p>Registered users can also create custom lists of ebooks, such as "Want to Read" or "Have Read". If you want to add a new book to its collection, register on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive website</a>, upload your book, and then create an entry on Open Library.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>With a quick search, you'll find ebooks in every genre, from art and sci-fi to medicine. The history collection, for example, features over 1.6 million titles. Luckily, you can filter the results by subject, author, and other criteria.</p><p>If you're looking for a particular book, enter its name in the search bar. Or you can click on random ebooks and preview or "borrow" them for free. Some people prefer <a href=#>audiobooks vs. physical books</a>, but you won't have to choose since this platform offers both.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Another interesting feature is the <strong>Search Inside</strong> feature. If you need a specific piece of information, you can choose an ebook related to that topic and enter your query in the search bar. Just think about how much time you could save!</p><h2 id=project-gutenberg>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Gutenberg</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/free-history-eBooks-1.png><p>Established in 1971, Project Gutenberg aims to digitize books and other cultural works. Today, it features over 60,000 free ebooks that you can download or read online. The best part is that you don't need a <a href=#>PDF or ebook reader for your computer</a> to access the titles in its collection.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Users can narrow down their search by title, popularity, author, language, and file type. They can also search by subject or by categories, such as audiobooks, pictures, or music.</p><p>While most ebooks are available in English, some have been published in Arabic, Ancient Greek, Navajo, or Mayan languages. This could be an opportunity to brush up on your language skills or even learn a foreign language from scratch.</p><p>Like Open Library, Project Gutenberg offers free ebooks in every category, from history and law to music, psychology, and science. Users also have access to "bookshelves" for specific content.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If, say, you want to learn more about the Spanish American War, you can go directly to that bookshelf instead of browsing through thousands of titles.</p><p>If you prefer <a href=#>Kindle over physical books</a>, you'll love using Project Gutenberg. When you select an ebook, you can choose to read it online, in plain text, or in Kindle format. There's also the option to download free ebooks in EPUB format, with or without images. This feature may come in handy if you have limited space on your smartphone or tablet.</p><h2 id=internet-archive>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-Archive-Website.jpg><p>Featuring over 32 million ebooks, the Internet Archive is the largest digital library ever created. In addition to free ebooks, its catalog includes 591 billion web pages and millions of videos, concerts, audio files, and software programs.</p><p>Think of the Internet Archive as a digital time machine. Some items in its collection date back to the '90s and are not available anywhere else.</p><p>The ebooks are organized by category, but you can also search by collection, author, topic, or year of publishing. There's also a huge selection of ebooks for those with disabilities. At the time of writing, the website features popular works such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Jaws, and Dune.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Users have the option to rate and review the books they read. If you find a book that looks interesting, click on it to see what others have to say. After registration, you can upload ebooks and other media files from your personal collection.</p><h2 id=wiley-online-library>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiley Online Library</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IT-free-books.png><p>Whether you're doing research for an essay, white paper, or science project, it can be difficult to find trustworthy sources. That's where the Wiley Online Library comes in handy.</p><p>This digital library offers over 22,000 online books, 1,600 journals, and hundreds of reference works. Most resources are science-focused, covering all topics.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business & Management collection</a>, for example, includes hundreds of ebooks and articles on consumer behavior, management, and business technology.</p><p>If you're ready to learn a new programming language, head over to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Technology section</a>. Narrow down your search by publication date, subject, author, or publisher.</p><p>Not all ebooks are free to read and download, but you can browse them or access specific chapters. Look for the <strong>Free Access</strong> icon to see which books are available for free.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=world-digital-library>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World Digital Library</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rare-books-online.png><p>Launched in 2009, the World Digital Library's selection of rare books, manuscripts, and other materials dates back to 8,000 BC. The collection includes more than 19,000 publications from over 190 countries.</p><p>This project was developed by the U.S. Library of Congress and UNESCO with the purpose of making culture available to everyone. It features thousands of books, photos, and maps that were once only available in certain galleries, so it's just like <a href=#>visiting virtual museums from home</a>.</p><p>Anyone can download the books for free. Depending on what you're interested in, you may want to check out the rare book collection on offer. There's also the option to search by place, topic, time period, language, or institution.</p><h2 id=free-ebooks>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Ebooks</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Free-Ebooks.jpg><p>Free Ebooks lets you access a trove of ebooks from every category, each of which you can find in a dedicated section—Fiction, Non-Fiction, Academic, Textbooks, Classics, and Others. Its digital library is pretty well stacked, and every title is neatly classified, so whatever you're looking for, you're bound to find it quick and easy.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Free Ebooks is a <a href=#>great place to download unique ebooks for free</a>, but it comes with a caveat. You can create a free account that lets you access free ebooks, but only five times a month and only in a PDF format.</p><p>After your five downloads for the month are done, you have to wait until the next one rolls around to continue downloading. If that doesn't work for you, the platform does offer a V.I.P. level account that starts at $7.95/month and lends you unlimited downloads in multiple formats besides PDF.</p><h2 id=bookbub>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bookbub</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bookbub.jpg><p>Bookbub has a dedicated free ebooks section that takes you to an extensive digital library full of free titles you can download. Its selection is ever-changing, so you're sure to find something fresh to read every time you browse.</p><p>Once you visit the free ebooks tab, you can further filter out the titles Bookbub shows you. You can choose the category, limiting it to one or several, as well as the retailer and collections. Bookbub's ebooks are available to read on all the prominent devices in the respective supported formats: Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, Apple Books, Google Play, and Kobo. Plus, there's no limit to how many ebooks you can download, so you can go wild.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=baen-free-library>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baen Free Library</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Baen-Free-Library.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baen Free Library</a> is a bit more niche since its digital library focuses on science fiction and fantasy titles. So, if that's right up your alley, look no further.</p><p>The digital library offers an array of ebooks you can read online or download for free. You can get the ebooks in the standard formats, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, or any device-specific ones for your eReader of choice. You can also email the ebook to an address of your choice.</p><p>The website looks a bit outdated when you first land on it, but don't let that stop you from using it.</p><h2 id=manybooks>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ManyBooks</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/many-books.jpg><p>ManyBooks does indeed have a lot of ebooks to offer. The digital library offers over 50,000 ebooks for you to explore, all of which come from every category and genre you can imagine. When looking through the online library, you can select your preferred genre, language, and rating to hone your search.</p><p>The digital library doesn't have a dedicated free section, so all the titles are mixed together. When you click on one, you can see whether it's free to download and read online or not. Each ebook comes with an extensive description of the story and the author, as well as a book excerpt and <a href=#>summary to understand the book you're considering</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>ManyBooks helps you find many known classics and discover new titles to tackle.</p><h2 id=smashwords>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smashwords</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Smashwords.jpg><p>Whereas other digital libraries ensure you have access to timeless classics, Smashwords goes the opposite direction. So, rather than finding Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne, you'd discover Around the World in 80 Pages by Sharon E. Cathcart on the platform.</p><p>Smashwords is considered an indie author hub where you can look for newly released titles. You can choose whether to read the ebooks online or download them. You can usually download each ebook in a variety of formats, including the most popular ones: PDF and EPUB.</p><p>When exploring the online library, you can refine your search by ticking the <strong>Free box</strong> and your preferred book length—under 20K words or over 20K, 50K, and 100K words.</p><p>At the time of writing, the platform boasts over 90,000 free ebooks, so there's a lot to explore.</p><h2 id=expand-your-horizons-and-keep-learning>Expand Your Horizons and Keep Learning</h2><p>As you already know, there's always room for growth. However, this doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on books and courses. Whether you want to learn a new language, develop your skills, or start a project, everything you need is at your fingertips.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For starters, visit these digital libraries and take your pick. Head over to the Internet Archive for a stroll back in time, or check out the World Digital Library to expand your cultural horizons. If you're doing research for a science paper or work project, go to the Wiley Online Library to get the facts straight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGibop%2BZqa6tecuimauZop6ytHnDqK6npJ%2BWsW6xwaimpKtdm7%2BmsY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdigital-libraries-download-ebooks-free.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./46-facts-about-the-movie-anna-and-the-king.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./46-facts-about-the-movie-anna-and-the-king.html>46 Facts about the movie Anna and the King</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./473370-who-steve-perrys-wife-how-times-married.html>Who is Steve Perry's wife, and how many times has he been married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./473370-who-steve-perrys-wife-how-times-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
