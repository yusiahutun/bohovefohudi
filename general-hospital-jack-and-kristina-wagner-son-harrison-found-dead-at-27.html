"Harrison was a bright, exuberant young man whose smile lit up any room he was in. He has left behind many men and family members who loved him deeply."</p><p>"We are heartbroken that he ultimately lost his battle with addiction and we hope that Harrison's memory will live on through this scholarship and will help other young men get help for their addiction that would not otherwise be able to afford it," she statement read. "All funds donated to the Harrison Wagner Scholarship Fund will be used to directly help young men pay their rent or a portion of their rent who could not otherwise afford their care at New Life House."</p><p>A number of stars from the GH community also shared their condolences to the Wagners, including show alum Michelle Stafford, who also tweeted out a link to the Scholarship Fund.</p><p>"I am posting for my beautiful friend Kristina. I know you all love her so much. Here is a way you can help, if you would like to. She put this together a couple days ago in honor of (her son) Harrison," she wrote.</p><p>Show EP Frank Valentini tweeted, "On behalf of myself and the entire #GH family, our hearts go out to Kristina Wagner, Jack, and their family during this devastating time. We ask that you respect their privacy and keep them in your thoughts."</p><p>Added Nancy Lee Grahn: "I join all of you in wrapping our arms around one of the sweetest souls I've ever met @KristinaWagnr. She is a most exceptional woman and mother. May she find some modicum of peace in this most anguishing time."</p><p>Charles Shaughnessy wrote, "In my short time on #GH I have seen the caring, generous spirit of Kristina Malandro ( Wagner). It is unbearable that she and her husband, Jack, should now be going through every parent's worst nightmare. They have my wife's and my deepest condolences and love."</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story below</p><p>Harrison Wagner -- the youngest child of <a href=#>"General Hospital"</a> alums <a href=#>Jack Wagner</a> and Kristina Wagner -- has passed away at the age of 27.</p><p>According to a Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner report, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Harrison was discovered in a Los Angeles parking lot on Monday.
