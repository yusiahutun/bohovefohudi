I was at a party in Brooklyn, loud reggae and techno, conversations about politics and culture. Around 11:25, I slipped into a bedroom, turned on the small TV, sipped a beer and waited for Andrew Dice Clay to host SNL.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnlqr84k77886xn@published data-word-count=67>The Diceman had been all over the news the previous week, including Nightline where Lorne Michaels explained his rationale for inviting Clay to host (and didn’t look very happy about it). Clay’s act was well known in the comedy world, but it was SNL that made him a cultural pariah. Suddenly, everybody had an opinion about his act, regardless of whether or not they’d actually seen it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnmqr84h8xucuzy@published data-word-count=59>Some of my more political friends painted Clay as a misogynist fascist who peddled hate speech. What kind of twisted mind thought he was funny? While I didn’t defend Clay, whose material was rather toxic, I pointed out that he was essentially playing a character, a Brooklyn loudmouth who thought he was slick, but was instead a leather-clad fool.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnnqr84algv5w7e@published data-word-count=64>I convinced no one, which didn’t matter since I wasn’t a fan of Clay’s to begin with; but there was no way I was going to miss the live show. Some of these friends wandered into that bedroom, gave me grief about indulging this sexist pig, but oddly enough sat through much of the episode with me. They didn’t laugh, but they didn’t leave.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnoqr84s159ez2m@published data-word-count=80>The main backstory, as you may know, dealt with Nora Dunn’s refusal to appear with Clay and subsequent personal boycott. She was soon followed by musical guest Sinéad O’Connor (who would later leave her own distinctive mark), and this put SNL in an awkward position. Plus, the women who remained were seen by some feminists as sellouts and collaborators. Not ideal conditions for creating comedy, but the media shitstorm, hate mail, and phoned threats did give the show added edge.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnpqr84vulskv2p@published data-word-count=77>It helped that at the time, SNL boasted a first-rate cast and strong writing staff. One of the best in the show’s history. As Christine Zander told me, “As writers, we went into work knowing that Dice wasn’t going to do whatever he wanted, he was going to do what we wrote for him. Simple as that. To think that having him host would allow him to do his offensive stage character on the show was absurd.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnqqr8418ffiaz6@published data-word-count=72>This turned out to be true. In a sense, the writers deconstructed the Diceman. Yes, he was in character, but put on a short leash. You got the essence of who he portrayed, yet the idiocy was exposed. Even his fans, who must have been confused by this tamer version, were chided for their lack of education. The SNL writers exerted full control. The boastful Dice was no match for that room.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnrqr84mfmqnk78@published data-word-count=79>Given all that, NBC still insisted on a five-to-seven-second delay. Live is live, and who knew what Clay in the moment might say. In the end, there really wasn’t much to censor. A sketch where Clay played a father explaining sex to his son (Mike Myers) had the word “poontang” repeatedly bleeped (though one slipped through), but clearly that was planned and part of the script. At no point did it appear that Clay would go off the rails.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xnsqr84tcnhw23c@published data-word-count=97>The closest it came to chaos was during the opening monologue. As Dice greeted the audience and joked about the controversy, several gay activists began heckling him. “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Clay go away!” they chanted before being led out by security. Clay responded in character, tossing in an anti-gay line as if to reinforce the protesters’ perception. Watching this (almost) live, I thought, man, this is gonna be a rocky night, which delighted me. It had been awhile since SNL courted danger, and I expected more outbursts as the show progressed. Clearly, NBC security had different ideas.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w10xntqr84filql8s9@published data-word-count=81>Clay’s outing remains one of the more self-referential SNL episodes, inescapable given the noise around it. Jan Hooks and Kevin Nealon delivered mock protest speeches; a running gag had TV Guide jeering the show for its tastelessness. Clay performed pretty well, though he later confessed that his blood pressure was through the roof. Naturally, the Dice show earned SNL its highest ratings of the season, so whoever was ultimately responsible for booking Clay knew that it would attract attention, however negative.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w20xnuqr840ssrwwht@published data-word-count=53>It also signaled the end of character-based standups. From Andy Kaufman to Bobcat Goldthwait to Joel Hodgson, Emo Phillips, and Judy Tenuta, the late 70s and most of the 80s saw a proliferation of performance artists play comedy clubs. Audiences accepted this, conditioned initially by Steve Martin, but also by whatever counterculture remained.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5w20xnvqr8421ehbc5f@published data-word-count=73>By 1990, different, in some cases cruder sensibilities emerged. It’s almost fitting that Andrew Dice Clay was one of the last characters from that era. Indeed, his show featured the first appearances of David Spade and Rob Schneider who, along with Adam Sandler and Chris Farley, would dominate SNL through the early 90s, ushering in “frat boy” humor that proved to be incredibly popular. Perhaps Nora Dunn anticipated more than she let on.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>When Andrew Dice Clay Came to ‘SNL’ and Controversy […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgbny4tMSnZJqmlKeyuHnDopqeZZOhrrp5wpqknmWkpHq0ustmmKecXZi8r8DRqK2eqqOueqe7y6WmsJ2UY7W1ucs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-andrew-dice-clay-came-to-snl-and-controversy-followed-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./507357-all-late-james-cannon-nick-cannons-real-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./507357-all-late-james-cannon-nick-cannons-real-father.html>Who is Nick Cannon's real father?
