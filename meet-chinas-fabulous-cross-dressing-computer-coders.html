More than 9,200 GitHub users have dropped by the Dress repository to give it a star of approval.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dress was started by a 19-year-old programmer from Guangzhou, in China’s southern province of Guandong, who prefers to be known as Akechi Satori.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Boys who pursue cuteness and choose to dress in an adorable style isn’t an outrageous thing … I originally just wanted to put mine and friends’ photos on there,” Satori said in an emailed statement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Satori, who identifies as a woman and started wearing feminine clothes several years ago, did not expect the Dress repository to receive as much attention as it has.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’d be false to say I don’t have a sense of achievement. But I’d like to thank all the lovelies who have contributed to the project and helped us get to know so many friends who have similar interests,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some Dress contributors do not show their faces in the photos and it is not possible to verify everyone’s genders.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">‘Big dudes in dresses’</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suji Yan, a Shanghai-based entrepreneur, is often credited as the programmer who first drew attention to the trend of cross-dressing coders, popularly known as “big dudes in dresses”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a now deleted 2013 online post, he observed that if he wrote code while cross-dressing, there were fewer bugs or errors in his work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I started cross-dressing in high school when I went to anime conventions. People told me I looked good in girl’s clothes,” Yan, 23, said in a phone interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trend spread and jokes on it have become widespread in the Chinese programming community. There is a saying that “four out of five programmers have cross-dressed”, while another jokes that coders start as junior programmer, then senior programmer and finally a cross-dressing programmer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yan, who is straight and recently married, said his wife has no problem with him cross-dressing but he does not cosplay as much as he used to now he is running a start-up that provides online privacy services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is another reason that made him pause.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wonder if the cross-dressing trend is harmful to the transgender community,” Yan said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some people cross-dress for comedic effect and terms like ‘big dudes in dresses’ can have a negative connotation.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from those who cross-dress for pleasure, the trend has become infamous as an entertainment feature at technology companies’ annual parties.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics have panned the practice – along with another popular party turn of having female staff wear provocative costumes at internet company events – as “low” and perpetuating negative stereotypes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lewd performances such as male colleagues cross-dressing in heavy make-up has become a standard at large Chinese internet companies,” PingWest, an online media portal focusing on technology, reported in 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The article went on to say that IT workers were already thought of as “distasteful, messy and perverted”. Even though these stereotypes were unfair, it said, Chinese internet companies were not helping.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Social stigma</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cross-dressing as a performance was not always stigmatised in China, and at least two of the country’s modern leaders, Zhou Enlai and Hu Jintao, performed in female theatrical roles as adolescents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen Yaya, a researcher in gender equality at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said cross-dressing had a long history in China, and had been widely practised before the age of the internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While there was a distinction between those who cross-dress for performances and those who do so for pleasure, the increased occurrence and acceptance of the two in China indicated society’s greater understanding of gender constructs and diversification of gender expression, she explained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cross-dressers have their own online spaces for communication and sharing. I think this is significant in promoting diversity in gender and expression,” Chen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet progress can be tenuous. Chen said the government’s strict control of the Chinese internet, as with other aspects of society, meant a safe space for the community was under threat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While GitHub, which hosts Dress, is still available in China, there are fears it may face censorship, after the Chinese IT community started a repository called 996. ICU to protest against unhealthy working conditions. It has become one of the most popular projects on the platform, with more than 230,000 stars from users.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">An act of rebellion</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The phenomenon of cross-dressing coders came under the national spotlight last year when one of China’s better known programmers appeared on a television programme in eastern China with his disapproving father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tang Feihu, who goes by the name Xiaodao, is a former Google software engineer and blockchain entrepreneur who has cross-dressed since high school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xiaodao and his father Tang Chengxiang appeared on Jiangsu TV’s Have Words to Say, a show which helps families and friends overcome conflicts. His father told the programme he did not understand why Xiaodao grew his hair long and cross-dressed. He said he was ashamed by his son’s actions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He wears dresses. How could I show my face?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/28/776a9572-6642-11e9-a2c3-042d2f2c8874_1320x770_222014.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tang senior said that, when he shared Xiaodao’s photos with his friends, people asked if it was his daughter because of Xiaodao’s appearance. When his son was younger, he would force him to get his hair cut in a conventional boy’s style.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The programme’s hosts, who mediated between the father and son, said Xiaodao’s unconventional style was not something to be ashamed of and that Tang senior’s forceful ways had probably made things worse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The softly spoken Xiaodao, who appeared wearing a long ponytail and gender neutral clothes, seemed to agree with their assessment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Take the haircuts for example, it’s a reflection of many things. He doesn’t accept some of my views,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Over time, I didn’t want to communicate with him any more. I didn’t think I could persuade him or make him understand.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xiaodao, who is bisexual, said he took to cross-dressing in part to rebel against his father and mainstream society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I started cross-dressing, I thought it was a way to go against the mainstream. If it becomes part of the mainstream, then I don’t see value in taking part in it any more,” he said in a phone interview with the South China Morning Post.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mainstream seems to be more accepting of cross-dressing, if the audience of Have Words to Say is anything to go by. A poll of the 200-strong live studio audience showed only one third felt Tang senior’s concerns were legitimate.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Diversity prevails</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Dress repository on GitHub has received its share of criticism from other programmers on V2EX, an online forum popular with the coding community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Simply put, it’s just transvestism. Are these things accepted now?” a V2EX user wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This kind of serious cross-dressing, I really can’t get on board with it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Satori is not bothered by detractors. She dresses how she feels, wearing feminine or casual clothes to work. Her colleagues have no objections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For those who don’t accept or don’t understand this phenomenon, no matter how much we debate, it won’t change their stance,” Satori said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In today’s diverse society, voices that support different ideas cannot be killed.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Cross-dressing computer coders take on stereotypes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0u8KinK2xX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2BlhHl8lmiknp2kYrCptc2aqmaekZfCrbvUrGScqp%2BowG6w0Z6qrKGenHqku8yprK2domKwsLDEq6o%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./frisk-ve-bad-officer-sexy-new-york-sheriff-s-deputy-inundated-female-attention-muscly-photos-viral-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./frisk-ve-bad-officer-sexy-new-york-sheriff-s-deputy-inundated-female-attention-muscly-photos-viral-html.html>New York Sheriff's deputy Miguel Pimentel inundated with female attention</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html>Kathy Wakile, With Splendid Net Worth, Moves to New House With Husband: Accomplished Big Project</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
