He has coached other teams and served in minor roles before being promoted to his current position. Doug has gone through many difficult times in his coaching career where he was thrown back and forth by teams, and even when he became a head coach he had very little support.</p><p>But despite the ups and downs, he has endured and is now not only one of the smartest and most dynamic head coaches in the National Football League (NFL), but he has also worked his way up to become one of the best coaches in the NFL and has written a book that will soon become a bestseller. He is the author of Fearless: How an Underdog becomes a champion.</p><h2><strong>Doug Pederson Biography</strong></h2><p>Doug Pederson was born on January 31, 1968, in Bellingham, Washington, and his star sign is Aquarius. He was born Douglas Irving Pederson as the son of his parents – Teri and Gordon Pederson. His father worked at Intalco Works, one of the largest distributors of aluminum and Colombian chemicals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Doug-Pederson.jpg><p>For his high school education, Doug attended Ferndale High School, where he was a three-time athlete. He played basketball, baseball, football and excelled in all three sports, but when it came time for college he chose football. He attended the University of Louisiana, where he played college football as a quarterback from 1987 to 1990.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Guerschon Yabusele Bio, Career Stats, Age, Height, Weight, And Family</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Playing Career</strong></h2><p>In May 1991, he was signed up as an uncalled-up free agent with the Miami Dolphins but did not play a single game for the team. Two months later, in August, he was released and spent a year without a team but was drafted by the New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) in March 1992 as reserve quarterback to Reggie Slacks. However, the Dolphins would re-sign him in March 1993, and in October he played his first NFL game for the Dolphins in a win over the New York Giants.</p><p>In 1995, the Dolphins again relinquished his contract and he moved to the Green Bay Packers as substitute quarterback. In 1999 he signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $4.5 million. In 2000, he played for the Cleveland Browns for a brief period before returning to the Packers the following year, where he signed a one-year contract that he extended annually until March 2005, when he announced his retirement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Doug-Pederson-Bio-1.jpg><h2><strong>Coaching Career</strong></h2><p>Doug Pederson was hired as head coach of a private Christian school called Calvary Baptist Academy in Shreveport, Louisiana. During his tenure as coach, his team made the state playoffs four years in a row. In 2007, he led the team to the first district title ever, and they only dropped out in the semi-finals.</p><p>In 2009, he joined the Philadelphia Eagles as their new quality control coach. Two years later he was promoted to quarterback coach. In 2013, Doug moved to the Kansas City Chiefs as an offensive coordinator and served as assistant to his longtime head coach Andy Reid for three years. In January 2016 he was reappointed as head coach by the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>He has been criticized as the least qualified coach ever to hold such a top job, but Doug managed to win the Super Bowl without the most impressive players. This unique success immediately made him the talk of the town and he made it from the least qualified coach to rank among other head coaches such as Jon Gruden, John Harbaugh, Sean Payton, and others who won the Super Bowl.</p><h2><strong>What is His Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Doug Pederson began his coaching career in 2005, and over the years his net worth has increased along with his Super Bowl win earnings – an opportunity every coach dreams of. His current net worth is $19 million. In May 2018, he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles that was only extended by three months from the previous contract. In August of the same year, he signed a contract extension that extended his contract with the franchise until 2022.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Solomon Thomas Bio, Sister, Parents, Family, Height, Weight</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Doug Pederson Wife and Family</strong></h2><p>They say true love finds you in the most unexpected places, and for Doug, it was a blind date with Jeanie. Blind dates can be so unexciting, but for Doug and his beloved wife, it was not. The two met in 1990 at Johnny’s Pizza in Munroe, Louisiana, and got married a year later. At the time, he was a college graduate while Jeanie was still in high school; they needed to be together and could not wait to graduate.</p><p>Life was not rosy for the couple at that time, as Doug was trying to build a career for himself while Jeanie was in school to get a nursing degree, but they stuck together and weathered the storms together. They have three sons together. Doug has admitted that his family has been his greatest support and motivation, both as a player who travels around the country and plays for different teams and as a coach. They currently live in New Jersey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksbDBxmannpyVp8CwuoywoJ%2BdXZuurrXLsmSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7JknKeRmLWqusZmmpqqlZq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoug-pederson-wife-family-biography-coaching-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./more-than-60000-fans-turned-out-for-rocklahoma-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./more-than-60000-fans-turned-out-for-rocklahoma-2023.html>More Than 60,000 Fans Turned Out For Rocklahoma 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christine-lampard-incredibly-rare-photo-stepdaughter-isla-birthday.html>Christine Lampard shares incredibly rare photo of stepdaughter Isla to mark special occasion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christine-lampard-incredibly-rare-photo-stepdaughter-isla-birthday.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
