After all, going all out on Oct. 31 means going all in, researching and shopping for the perfect pieces and props to ensure your look is as epic as possible. In addition to binge-watching <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup tutorials,</a> Instagram is essential for creating something sexy or spooky. Outfits from years past provide plenty of inspiration, especially when it comes to plus-size Halloween costumes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since 2020 will likely include smaller, socially distanced or Zoom celebrations, it's worth it to skip mass-produced bagged costumes this year, trying a unique DIY costume instead. On top of allowing you to be creative, this option consists of clothes you have or would have bought anyway, so you know for a fact you'll look and feel your best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, we've rounded up 21 plus-size Halloween costumes from Instagram that are sure to stroke your creative fire.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Snow White</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Listen, we love Elsa and Anna as much as the next Disney-obsessee, but OG princesses like Snow White will always hold a special place in our hearts. Plus, thanks to this vibrant color scheme — which can easily be created with the help of a blue tank, a yellow skirt, and a red belt (<strong>Shop Similar: </strong>$12; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a>) — your look will truly pop against the season's moody hues.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cruella de Vil</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like a spider waiting for the kill, this Cruella de Vil costume is worthy of a double-take. The 101 Dalmatians villain is a bad-tempered fashion icon, and dressed in a black dress and (faux!) fur coat, you get to act sassy and look sexy all night. If you have pups of your own, feel free to bring 'em along; furry friends will make this look even better.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Dorothy Gale</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of costumes that are pet-friendly, why not dress as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz? A white top layered under a blue sleeveless dress (<strong>Shop Similar: </strong>$129) is pretty much all you'll need, while pigtails and ruby red shoes — AKA those famous glass slippers — will finish it off. If you really want to take it to the extreme, throw in a picnic basket and just Instagram this costume from home. They do say there's no place like it (especially during a pandemic).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Two-Face</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the saying goes, two is better than one, and in this case, it just might be true. On Halloween, channel the Batman supervillain Two-Face for double the fun. While this costume requires some makeup fun (even a smokey eye on one side, with more natural on the other), we love the dichotomy of lingerie and a blazer here, cleverly held together by a belt.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Pineapple</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether your inspiration is SpongeBob or you just really love this tropical fruit, you'll definitely be the life of any celebration dressed in all-yellow everything. DIY a leafy headpiece with green construction paper, then accessorize with yellow shades and a pineapple-shaped cup to sip from all night.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Not-So-Basic Witch</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An easy way to add an imaginative spin on the classic witch costume is to think in terms of texture or incorporate color into the traditional black outfit. Reach for a black dress that features lace or puff-sleeves, or amp up a more classic design with accessories like capes, hats, tights, magical props, and creative makeup.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ursula the Sea Witch</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halloween is made up of 24 prime bewitching hours, and clearly, there are countless enchantresses to dress up as — especially if you're choosing from the Disney category. This Ursula from The Little Mermaid costume is perfect for those looking to enter the realm of black magic on All Hallow's Eve. All you'll need is a sea shell necklace <strong>(Shop Similar:</strong> $42; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>overstock.com</a>) to store all the voices you're bound to steal, a tank top or corset, and a purple maxi skirt (<strong>Shop Similar: </strong>$50; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a>).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Unicorn</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same purple skirt will come in handy if you're looking for a costume that's quick and uncomplicated, such as a unicorn. The only piece really needed here is the horn (which you can make by twisting a piece paper into a cone shape, then gluing it onto a headband). Otherwise, think fluffy and sparkly for the rest of your outfit and the results will be nothing short of magical.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cher Horowitz</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Clueless <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrates its 25th anniversary</a>, we're betting we'll see plenty of Cher Horowitz's best style moments on Instagram come Nov. 1. The character's iconic yellow plaid ensemble is surprisingly easy to recreate in 2020; style a yellow tartan skirt (<strong>Shop Similar: </strong>$12) with a matching blazer, or wear a plain white t-shirt under a yellow plaid dress. Be sure to "As If" your way out of everything throughout the night.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Scarecrow</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If it just so happens that you already have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plaid, cozy flannel</a> in your fall wardrobe, your Halloween costume is almost complete. The truth is, scarecrow looks are 90% makeup, 10% clothing items. Use black eyeliner to draw a stitched-on smile extending from the corner of your lips to the center of your cheeks, heavily shade in your waterline, and brush on a deep red-orange blush at the apples of your cheeks. Top off your look with a straw hat and throw on some jeans or pair of overalls, if you have them.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Miss Trunchbull</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With rumors of a film adaptation of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Matilda The Musical coming to Netflix</a>, this childhood favorite has been on our minds. If wherever you reside is particularly chilly in October, we suggest dressing up as the terrifying Miss Trunchbull, as her signature look is easily the comfiest of the cast. Simply pair track pants (<strong>Shop Similar: $29</strong>) with a grey pull-over, secure a thick belt high around the torso, stomp around in old hiking boots, and threaten to send people to the "the chokey."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Susie Carmichael</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another unforgettable '90s character to dress up as? Susie from the cartoon Rugrats. Break out a bright yellow dress and pin on a few pieces of purple fabric to mimic her printed look. Be sure to match your red shoes to your hair ties and befriend some babies.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rosie the Riveter</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rosie the Riveter might be the easiest costume to pull together last-minute, because you likely own everything needed to emulate the cultural icon. If you're still struggling for ideas days before Halloween, throw on a pair of jeans and a denim button-down, and tie a red bandana around your hair. Also, don't be surprised if your arm hurts for the next few days. You'll be expected to flex for photos.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rory Gilmore</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fine, we lied. Rosie the Riveter isn't the easiest Halloween costume you can piece together — Rory Gilmore is. Luke's Diner mugs and to-go cups are plentiful on Etsy, and as far as an actual costume is concerned, what you'd normally wear on a crisp fall afternoon is probably perfect (a knit and some denim will do). Just add a stack of books along with a Pop Tart and you've got the whole vibe down pat.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lizzo</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>A bodysuit</a> is one of the most beloved pieces in our closet, and at the same time, happens to be the singer's signature. Wear a colorful or sparkly one with a pair of combat boots — and a tiny purse! — to get the look, or layer a pink option over bike shorts and belt it to recreate Lizzo's retro "Juice" video.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Winifred Sanderson</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If Halloween had mascots, they would probably be the Sanderson sisters. You really can't go wrong dressing up as either Sarah, Winifred, or Mary for Halloween, but Winnie is by far the baddest witch on the block. Instead of playing it safe with a bagged costume, go thrifting for a vintage green dress. Just don't forget the fiery red wig (it's Winnie's signature, after all).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Gumball Machine</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This gumball machine costume is super sweet, especially for anyone looking to get a little crafty. Take a basic tank, T-shirt, or long-sleeved top and stick on some tightly packed, colorful pom poms with super glue. For a bottom, opt for a red, tulle skirt or pants.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Poison Ivy</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike other costumes you can put together in a pinch, the decision to pose as Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy can't be a rash one. (Get it?) There are a few different avenues you can go down to emulate the Batman bad girl: go all-out with a sexy green dress, or opt for a more casual look with a simple green top and black pants. Either way, accessorizing with fake ivy leaves is a must, and don't be shy when experimenting with different shades of green eyeshadow and lipstick.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ellie Sattler</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If 2020 ends with a dinosaur comeback, we honestly wouldn't be surprised. And, sure, this Jurassic Park outfit might not be the most practical thing to wear while taking on a T-Rex, but it's extremely nostalgic (and kind of on-trend). Invest in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>some khakis</a> and style them with T-shirt before knotting a button-down over your outfit. Then, add a black belt and lug sole boots to bring things back to 1993.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_110-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pennywise</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_113-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If spooky and scary is more your thing, go for It. While Pennywise is another costume that requires some effort in the makeup department, the costume itself is fairly simple, especially if you already own something white with puff sleeves or ruffles. Pom poms will work as buttons and are easy to pin on, while a red balloon and a creepy smile will take things to the next level.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_115-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, it's almost impossible scroll through social media and not see someone dancing to "WAP." So, why not dress up like the women who brought us the song of 2020? A pink or yellow off-the-shoulder design and matching gloves will have you looking like a member of this famous crew, no impressive flexibility required. For an extra hint, we suggest carrying around "macaroni in a pot."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2S9rcHSZqqispVitaK4y6iunp2eYrCwv9OupJ6r</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fplus-size-halloween-costumes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ayla-kell-boyfriend-dating-engaged-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ayla-kell-boyfriend-dating-engaged-html.html>Ayla Kell Boyfriend, Dating, Engaged, Family, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wrangler-leon-bridges-collection.html>Wrangler x Leon Bridges 29-Piece Collection Has Officially Dropped</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wrangler-leon-bridges-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
