And before anyone thinks that the whole thing was a stunt, it was pre-fame for both of them. Simpson had yet to release her first album and 98º's own debut had just hit the charts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After we met," Lachey told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">People</a> in 2003, "I found myself looking through the crowds for her all night."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lachey said that he fell in love with her voice in addition to everything else. In a joint interview with CBS News, he said, "The first time I ever heard her sing, I got chills. And I told the guys [in 98º], 'I'm going to marry that girl one day.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>S</strong>he was just 22 when they got married and her dad famously objected to the entire relationship, but Simpson said it was true love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"With Nick, I was madly in love," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "I mean, I loved everything about the guy and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I was, you know, 22 years old when we got married but I thought I knew my future and I thought he was gonna be in it forever. I thought my dad was completely wrong. I was like, 'No, I got this figured out. Watch.' You know? Like, I'll prove you wrong."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>For an entire generation, Newlyweds was one of the first times that celebrities gave cameras access to everything, from everyday fights over Louis Vuitton dog carriers to confusing chicken with tuna. In addition to following the pair on TRL, everyone got to see them at home, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were young and pioneering our way through reality television, always mixed and always on," Simpson wrote in her 2020 memoir, Open Book. "We worked and we were great at it but when it came time to being alone, we weren't great at it anymore."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Without the success of Newlyweds, however, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">TV landscape</a> would probably be very, very different. So, any die-hard fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians should take note: 2003 was the year Newlyweds, The Bachelor, and American Idol all debuted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simpson referenced key moments from the show in her song "With You."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>Newlyweds ran for three seasons from 2003-2005. During the show's run, the two were bonafide A-listers and Simpson used the opportunity to become one of America's sweethearts. With so many iconic moments, it's strange to think that the show's not streaming anywhere. Fellow '00s reality icon Nicole Richie apparently spends a lot of time <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">re-watching the show</a> via YouTube clips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>Lachey and Simpson announced their separation in November 2005, the day before Thanksgiving, and the divorce was official on June 30, 2006.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The holiday didn't overshadow the news. The two cited "irreconcilable differences" in their divorce. They famously had no prenuptial agreement, which meant that Simpson <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly had to pay</a> her ex-husband $12 million.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's also eight years older than me so he was already so grown up when I wasn't, so once I started to, you know, get covers and get endorsement deals that were separate from him — 'cause we did everything together — there was a little bit of tension," Simpson told ET. "And, like, a lot less support. And I just felt in our marriage that we really were kind of spinning and trying to tolerate each other towards the end because we were so used to being miced up or onstage or you know, the world took us in so many ways, and they put us as a trophy couple that we actually weren't. I mean, we were at the beginning but it fell out pretty quick."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Post-Jessica, Lachey released "What's Left of Me," which would go on to become his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-charting</a> track as a solo artist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The team behind Newlyweds offered some insight, saying that they could almost see the separation coming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You could feel there was tension between the two of them. They were very different people. He was a blue-collar guy — he did a lot of things himself, like he and his brother would build things. He was frugal, and she had excessive taste. In the end, they weren't suited for each other. The only thing they really had in common was their music," Newlyweds producer Sue Kolinsky said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>. "She was really young; I think he's seven years older than her. He wanted a family, and her father thought maybe she was too young. Her father was very involved in her life."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Granitz/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Lachey kept things in the MTV family. After Simpson, he married MTV VJ Vanessa Minnillo (who appeared in his music video for "What's Left of Me") in 2011. The two share three children: Phoenix, Camden, and Brooklyn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simpson would eventually date NFL tight end Eric Johnson. The two married in 2014 and have three children: Birdie, Ace, and Maxwell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2ailajAqq%2FAZqqipaCovK95zaKapGWclrCpsdg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patricia-clarkson-didnt-eat-for-10-days-before-the-golden-globes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patricia-clarkson-didnt-eat-for-10-days-before-the-golden-globes.html>OMG!Golden Globe Winner Patricia Clarkson Admits She Didnt Eat For 10 Days Before The Award Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jane-moore.html>Jane Moore: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jane-moore.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
