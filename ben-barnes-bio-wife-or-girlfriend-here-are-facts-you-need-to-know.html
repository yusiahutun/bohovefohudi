His notable film roles include his role as Prince Caspian in The Chronicles of Narnia and its sequel, Billy Russo in The Punisher, and Logan Delos in the science thriller Westworld.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ben Barnes Bio</strong></h2><p>The actor was born on August 20, 1981, by Tricia and Thomas Barnes under the birth name Benjamin Thomas Barnes. He is the first child of his parents and has only one sibling, who is his brother Jack Barnes. Ben’s early education took place at the Homefield Preparatory School in Sutton and at King’s College School in Wimbledon. He also holds a BA Honours from Kingston University, where he studied Drama and English Literature.</p><p>Ben became interested in entertainment as a teenager when he started playing in musical theaters, and at fifteen he got his first big job as a drummer for the musical remake of Bugsy Malone. In 2006, Ben began his acting career by appearing in the series Doctors, where he was cast as Craig Unwin, and the following year, 2007, he was given his most popular role as Prince Caspian in the series The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.</p><p>Over the years, the actor has been given roles in the films Simple Virtue, Dorian Gray, Locked Up, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Journey of the Dawn Kicker, Killing Bono, The Words, The Great Wedding, By the Gun, Jackie & Ryan and the epic film Seventh Son.</p><p>The actor has also appeared in sitcoms such as Split Decision, Sons of Liberty, Exposed, Westworld, where he is still cast as Logan Delos, and in the ongoing series The Punisher, where he plays the title role of Billy Russo.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Michael Rooker Bio, Wife, Daughter, Net Worth And Other Interesting Facts</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is He Gay? Wife Or Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Ben Barnes has aroused a lot of curiosity about his sexuality, as the actor has openly stood behind the LGBT community. Moreso has also been cast as a gay man in some of his films, as in Dorian Gray. Ben Barnes was also cast as a gay man in the Westworld sitcom, one of his most popular works to date. Although it has not been proven with certainty that Ben is gay, speculation is still hovering around him. However, since the actor has had some relationships with women in the past, it can be assumed that he is heterosexual.</p><p>As far as his dating timeline is concerned, there is a rumor that Ben Barnes was the love interest of Felicity Jones, but the suspicions have subsided when she finally married and is currently the wife of film director Charles Guard. In 2009, Tamisan Egerton was paired with the actor, as seen in each other’s company in Australia, but even that quickly faded when the couple revealed that they only had a cordial relationship and had no tendency towards a romantic relationship.</p><p>Next on the list of his girlfriends is the actress Amanda Seyfried, with whom he is said to have been together for a while in early 2013. Amanda was his co-star in the 2013 film The Big Wedding, and it is said that the couple formed a strong bond during the shooting. Amanda also revealed in an interview that she actually admires Ben Barnes. However, the two lovebirds separated sometime in July of the same year for unknown reasons.</p><p>In 2017 there were renewed rumors of a romantic relationship between Ben and Meganne Young, triggered by a picture they published on social media sometime in April 2017. However, as in his previous relationships, the actor broke up with Meganne again, and no new relationship has been established with anyone since then.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Brandon Mychal Smith Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Siblings, Is He Gay?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Other Facts To Know About&nbsp;Ben Barnes</b></h2><ul><li>Ben Barnes was one of them a member of the boy band Hyrise.</li><li>His nickname is Bin Bons.</li><li>Sources say that he is a clumsy dancer.</li><li>They say that he loves the movie This Is Spinal Tap.</li><li>He stands at a height of 6 ft 1 in or 185 cm and weighs 83 kg or 183 lb.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kr6a6jJuYq6aVqHqjtc5mrqKelWK8s3nGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKGcq51dlr%2BmecWamq2rXa68tnnNnpydZaSkeqy6zrBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-barnes-bio-wife-or-girlfriend-here-are-facts-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hayden-panettiere-plays-tennis-and-basketball-romantic-holiday-wearing-bikini-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hayden-panettiere-plays-tennis-and-basketball-romantic-holiday-wearing-bikini-html.html>Hayden Panettiere plays tennis AND basketball during her romantic holiday...while wearing nothing bu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-face-wash-for-oily-skin-8362629.html>The 20 Best Face Washes for Oily Skin of 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-face-wash-for-oily-skin-8362629.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
