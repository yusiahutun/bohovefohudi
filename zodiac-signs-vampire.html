<time>05 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There’s something endlessly alluring about the supernatural, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the vampire that captures each zodiac sign</a> is no different. It’s no wonder these cold and attractive beings are to die for, which explains why they’ve been a muse for storytelling throughout the history. The only thing more mystifying than these nocturnal creatures is their wicked sex appeal. Everything from a vampire’s bloodthirsty archetype to their romantic mysticism can lure you in, like a moth to a flame.</p><p>Think about it: Who would Edward Cullen be if he wasn’t secretly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>flying into Bella’s bedroom</a> in the middle of the night just to watch her sleep? In the real world, this particular “love language” is anything but normal (or healthy), but what makes it “wrong” is precisely what makes it so enticing. Vampires are equally as attractive as they are terrifying, but if fantasizing about your all-time favorite onscreen vampire is wrong, I don’t want to be right.</p><p>Astrologically, a vampire’s charisma is a hybrid of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>romantic Venus</a> and destructive Pluto energy but still, it’s always a bit more Plutonian than Venusian. Being the Lord of the Underworld, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pluto is the planet of death</a>, rebirth, and all that is forbidden. It’s symbolic of the shadow self, namely the unseen forces surrounding every situation. Addiction, obsession, and sexuality are also themes that fall under this macabre aesthetic. Venus, on the other hand, would be the root of a vampire’s beauty, fatal charm, and knack for the art of seduction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-19-1.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-vampire-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Vampire That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Wondering what it would be like to combine your shadowy attributes with what makes you utterly irresistible? Here is the vampire that best resembles your zodiac sign:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Aries: You’re Lestat de Lioncourt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/l-intro-1628872647.jpeg><p>“Don’t be afraid. I’m going to give you the choice I never had.” Despite being damned for all-eternity, you’d make a bold and dangerous vampire. You prefer to live in the moment and follow your carnal instincts, not to mention indulge in the pleasure of the kill. Truth be told, this form of audacity, vanity and defiance very much aligns with your planetary ruler, Mars. Why else would you be nicknamed the “Brat Prince”? Like the iconic Lestat from Interview With a Vampire, you’re a force to be reckoned with and… well, you’re also no stranger to provoking your prey with mind games.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Taurus: You're Edward Cullen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/5da8aa7a695b581773751225.webp?w=650"><p>Cold, stoic, and sullen—like it is every day in the small town of Forks—your strange weather is equally as consistent as it is stubborn. Like Venus—your irresistible planetary ruler—you and Edward Cullen from Twilight are blessed with striking good looks and a sparkling skin that sets you apart from others. The irony of your insatiable desire for human blood, however, is the way you manage to contain it. This desire is very challenging for you to repress, given the intensity of your five senses, and the haunting lure of Bella Swan’s intoxicating scent. Your sense of security is a priority.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Gemini: You're Damon Salvatore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Vampire-Diaries-Season-8-Damon.jpg.webp?w=650"><p>Are you the hero or the villain? Only you can get away with being both the antagonist and the protagonist, Gemini. Mercury—your planetary ruler—has everything to do with siblings, which can resemble Damon’s polarizing relationship with his brother, Stephan. The sibling rivalry present in The Vampire Diaries is as real as that mischievous twinkle in a Gemini’s eyes, especially when they’re up to no good. Damon is also very eager to go above and beyond to put his brother through complete misery, but the dark side of his affections for Katherine (and Elena Gilbert) are where things get even more intriguing. Your superhuman speed can explain why you often appear out of thin air with a snarky remark or two.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Cancer: You're Selene</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/5k8dL4R.jpeg><p>Are you even surprised that your vampire is named after the Greek goddess of the moon? Selene from Underworld is an immortal huntress and “death dealer” who hunts and kills in the night, which also resembles moon goddess Artemis. She, too, was considered a goddess of the hunt who captured her prey under moonlight. Similar to the depth of your emotional memories, Selene never forgot the real reason why she became a vampire centuries ago, and this is the very same reason why she’s out for revenge. Let’s face it, Cancer: if you were a vampire, a small part of you would remain human forever.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4433534743202><h2>Leo: You’re Santanico Pandemonium</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/intro-1645118429.webp?w=650"><p>“You’ll be my slave because I don’t think you’re worthy of human blood.” You’re the life of the party, and a natural-born entertainer (cue <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the song “After Dark”</a>). Leo is always being crowned astrological royalty, which is why you’re none other than From Dusk Till Dawn‘s Santanico Pandemonium—a vampire queen who loves taking the stage. The guests at the night club are also completely mesmerized by your sultry physique and seductive dance number, but when your lust for blood passes a certain threshold, your superhuman strength and horrifying reptile form are quick to take over.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Virgo: You're Jessica Hamby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jessica-Hamby.True-Blood.webp?w=650"><p>“Lady, you have no idea how little control I have over my actions!” Those who aren’t familiar with a Virgo’s dark side have yet to see what lies beneath your elegance, obedience, and poise. Jessica Hamby—the iconic baby vampire from True Blood—grew up homeschooled and lived her father’s strict rules before becoming a bloodthirsty creature of the night. Like Jessica, you’re equally as dutiful as you are rebellious. The rebellion, however, is the result of others questioning your truth and integrity. Jessica’s ability to Daywalk can also resonate with your zodiac sign, as Virgo governs day-to-day affairs and responsibilities.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Libra: You're Victoria</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Why-Bryce-Dallas-Howard-was-recast-as-Victoria-in-Eclipse.jpeg><p>True love would be the root of a Libra’s undying vengeance, but your calculating mind and femme-fatale beauty would make you an even more formidable vampire. Losing your lover James left you feeling paranoid and vulnerable, which is why you’ll stop at nothing to exact revenge on “vegetarian” vampire Edward Cullen. Because James was taken from her, she thinks taking Bella Swan’s from Edward even the scores. After all, Libra is the zodiac sign of Justice. “I’m the one with the wicked curve ball.” You’re vain and Venusian, and like Victoria—Twilight‘s main antagonist—you’re also lethal when scorned.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Scorpio: You're Count Dracula</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxresdefault.jpeg><p>Scorpio is the most goth and bloodthirsty zodiac sign of all. You’re literally ruled by death planet Pluto and war planet Mars—need I say more? You would be the most famous vampire in pop culture, because anything less would be a disservice to the zodiac sign that lives in the Underworld. Similar to your deeply passionate nature and smoldering fixations, Count Dracula’s pursuit of reconnecting with his true love captures the piercing intensity of your haunting obsession. “I have crossed oceans of time to find you.” As for your strengths and abilities, it’s all about the shadow manipulation.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Sagittarius: You're Buffy Summers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Slaypire.webp?w=650"><p>Embracing your destiny is easier said than done when you’re meant to slay vampires, but you’re brave enough to explore the possibilities and question them in the process. Your strength lies in your supernatural experiences, and the way you fearlessly venture into the wild unknown. Similar to Buffy Summers, your wisdom and truth-seeking personality are some of your greatest assets, because all you want more than anything is to live a normal life. As if slaying blood-sucking vampires wasn’t enough, Buffy temporarily became a Slaypire (combining the powers of both a slayer and a vampire) at one point. So, to say you’ve “been there, done that” would be an understatement.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Capricorn: You're Eric Northman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Eric-Northman.True-Blood.webp?w=650"><p>“Everything ends… even the immortals.” Pessimistic much? It’s not you, it’s your sullen and stoic ruling planet: Saturn. Capricorn kicks off the winter season, and Eric Northman’s viking wisdom is more than a thousand years old. Wickedly strategic and undeniably loyal, you somehow manage to remain cool, calm, and collected amidst a killing spree. Like you, Eric from True Blood has quite the tough exterior, but this still doesn’t take away from his feelings. You tend to be unapologetic when it comes to your truth, but you can also come across as cold and aloof. Perhaps it’s because you’re the oldest and strongest vampire in Louisiana.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Aquarius: You're Blade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MV5BMjIwMzQxMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA3NjkwNQ@@._V1_.jpg><p>“Forget what you think you know. My name is Blade” Even as a bloodsucking vampire, the last thing you are is ordinary and you are far from fitting in. As a stoic and emotionally detached human-vampire hybrid, Blade has one objective—to rid the earth of other vampires. This enduring contradiction, along with your “lone-wolf” persona, very much resembles your Aquarian flare for irony. You are, after all, quite prone to approaching situations with an avant-garde perspective. Your gifted intellect and superhuman senses makes blade a Uranus-ruled Vampire through and through.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Pisces: You're Angel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/A2_Angel_02.jpg><p>You’re a Pisces, which makes you highly adaptable and in-tune with changing energies It makes sense, as being born under a mutable water sign makes you quite the expert at walking in-between other realms and dimensions. It’s also no coincidence that you were turned after a habitual night under the influence, as this very much resembles your Neptune, your evasive planetary ruler. The same goes for themes of illusion and deception. After all, what’s the real difference between a Pisces and an angel? Like Angelus from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you are both heaven and hell, but being a vampire with a “soul” makes you unique among your kind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbsLApqeiqpVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-vampire.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./an-uninhibited-candice-warner-nick-cummins-strip-naked-sas-australia-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./an-uninhibited-candice-warner-nick-cummins-strip-naked-sas-australia-html.html>An uninhibited Candice Warner andNick Cummins strip naked on SAS Australia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rona-anderson.html>Rona Anderson obituary | Film</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rona-anderson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
