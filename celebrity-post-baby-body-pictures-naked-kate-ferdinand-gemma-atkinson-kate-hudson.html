She acknowledged that she doesn’t feel "totally happy" with her body after giving birth, but added she had "no intention" of "rushing to get her body back".</p><p id=es9MIeA4bPOj data-wc=90>She wrote: "With Sienna nearing 10 weeks old nothing has given me more purpose than knowing that a small life depends entirely on me to feed and nourish her as she grows. I try to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle and I count myself lucky that throughout my adult life I’ve felt and identified as pretty body confident but now all that has changed along with every other aspect of my life, which makes me look at my body in a totally new light and it’s been a big adjustment!</p><p id=eHT5CoyhQukx data-wc=105>"Fitting into my pre pregnancy clothes seems a long way off and I have no intention of rushing into ‘getting my body back’ but it would be a lie if I said I feel totally happy and at one with my body post pregnancy. The process has been made a lot harder by some overly strong and hurtful comments online about my appearance (as much as you try and ignore them). I’m in awe of what my body has achieved over the last year but I find it hard not seeing the girl I know to be me looking back at me in the mirror.</p><p id=e18w7kmRaIfE data-wc=116>"I now see photos of myself pre-pregnancy and remember thinking at the time I didn’t like my body at certain angle but now I look back and think I looked great! It’s made me realise how critical I am of myself and how it’s so crucial, as women, that we learn to let ourselves off the hook. My mantra has always been that you exercise because you love your body not because you hate it, so any movement I do now is with the intention to feel good and never to punish myself. Sienna is worth every extra inch, pound and stretch mark. My body made me a Mother and for that I'll always be grateful."</p><p id=eoN5bcwymECR data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>17 celebrity mums who advocate for breastfeeding their babies in public</a></strong></p><h2>Gemma Atkinson</h2><p id=e-Ich5Crzmvi data-wc=69><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a></strong> star Gemma Atkinson proudly posted a series of photos of herself six and a half weeks after giving birth to her daughter Mia via C-section.

Her words resonated with thousands of fans who took to the comments section to share their own experiences, while Kate also shared what she has learned about giving herself, and her body, a break.</p><p id=eMrGUXGszAXl data-wc=59>She wrote: "I’ve really held off on uploading any pictures with my body in because last time I did, for some reason, I felt all types of nerves and ended up deleting it ... hormones, or the pressure of Instagram to look a certain way?

I miss feeling fit & strong!</p><p id=euRlOr8bzlAO data-wc=94>"As women, our bodies go through so much & I feel like there is so much pressure to ‘bounce back’ when it’s just not realistic, especially with a newborn. I mean how tough is it to find the energy to exercise? Some days I am like a machine working out, walking, eating healthy and feeling on top of the world and other days (like yesterday) I haven’t found time for the exercise and I’m caught tucking my head in the sweet cupboard looking for some sugar in the hope it will keep me awake.</p><p id=ewTMMr9NjUYl data-wc=80>"I'm learning that it's ok if you don't love your post baby body. It’s amazing if you love your post baby body but it’s also ok and normal if you don’t. It doesn't mean you haven’t loved the process of bringing your child into the world and it's ok to want to feel back to the ‘old you’. It doesn’t mean we love our children any less..

The routine with our baby is getting more familiar and I’m ready to start taking a little time in the day focusing on myself. For me that means my health. Why?

I wish it wasn't even a question we had to be asked. And I've seen women being shamed for their body's ability to naturally shake off their weight. The truth is we're all so different, and right now I'm just fascinated at how my body is changing daily.
