She left her role in Casualty in April this year - but not before she left a legacy of sizzling pics.</p><p>In one snap, the soap temptress bared it all in a strappy white vest top, as she exposed her freckled collarbones to her Instagram followers. The brunette beauty had her incredible tattoo on display, which skims the edge of one boob, as she posed candidly for the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28877001.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_pat1.jpg><p>She’d opted for a low-key makeup look to show off her natural beauty, with scarlet lipgloss and just a hint of mascara, letting her freckles roam free. Amanda captioned the snap: "Had the fabric shears out again!" as she debuted her barely-there tank top.</p><p>In another snap ahead of the 2018 BAFTA Cymru Awards, Amanda had opted for a different look entirely. The stunning star had her grey locks teased into ringlets, as she flashed flesh in a sinfully slashed white blazer - revealing just a hint of sideboob.</p><p>She paired the look with bright red lipstick and dark eyeliner as she smouldered for the cameras. She looks hotter than ever.</p><h3>Faye Morton - Patsy Kensit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Equally famous for her roles as Faye Morton in Holby and as Sadie King in <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Emmerdale</a>, Patsy Kensit has also - understandably - made her name as a model. Patsy has also had a whole host of famous marriages (and divorces), as she’s even been wed to Oasis brother Liam Gallagher from 1997 until 2000.</p><p>Patsy has never been afraid to bare it all for the camera, and has even treated fans to a glimpse of nipple during her modelling days. In one snap, Patsy downright smouldered for her adoring fans as she rocked a sheer floral tank top, which barely rose to cover her assets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article23847520.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Casualtys-Amanda-Mealings-hottest-snaps-as-her-last-episode-tonight.jpg><p><b>Have you joined Threads? Follow Daily Star to keep up to date on all things showbiz </b><a href=# rel=nofollow><b>here</b></a></p><p>The toned beauty paired the see-through top with a pair of barely-there knickers as she flaunted her trim figure. She even stripped completely naked when starring as Caroline Wright in Blame It On The Bellboy back in 1992.</p><h3>Jac Naylor - Rosie Marcel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234550.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-Beauty-Awards-2019.jpg><p>Rosie has played her Holby character Jac Naylor since 2004. The star isn’t averse to stripping down for a good cause, and made headlines last year as she posed topless - all in aid of an animal charity.</p><p>Rosie laid herself bare with just an Animal Trust book laid open to cover her most intimate areas, leaving nothing to the imagination. The fiery redhead posed seductively for the camera as she brought one hand to rest by her mouth, her hoodie shucked off on the chair beside her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15293181.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Patsy-Kensit-1252965><p>Writing alongside the snap, Rosie posted to Instagram: "I promised @nawtuk #Berkshire I’d do anything I could to sell this book to raise some much needed funds and I’ve heard sex sells so. Sorry?!?!</p><p>"Sex only sells if you're under the age of 25 with rippling muscles and go to your (home) gym four times a day? Awkward. I'll just get right back into my hoodie then. What a plonker!" Rosie joked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234560.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Holby-Citys-Rosie-Marcel-topless.jpg><p>She continued: "On a serious note these are really tough times for many charities. If you can afford to support #NAWTBerkshire by buying Julian Rota's new book or simply donating, it would mean everything to them and me."</p><p>The saucy snap garnered more than 5,000 likes on social media, including one from Corrie star Daniel Brocklebank. And fans rushed to comment, with one writing: "You look sexy to me, I haven’t even noticed the book yet!".</p><h3>Chrissie Williams - Tina Hobley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Holby-Citys-Rosie-Marcel-topless.jpg><p>Tina, who plays Chrissie Williams in Holby, certainly isn’t afraid to strip herself bare for keen soap fans. Though she has posed completely naked in the past, Tina does "wonder why" she did the pics.</p><p>She told The Sun as she prepared to compete on skiing contest programme The Jump in 2016: "I do look back and wonder why I did them. It was because someone, somewhere, put me in front of a camera and told me to do those pictures.</p><p>"I’m quite a good girl so I do what I’m told to do," she confessed. Regardless, Tina regularly sets pulses racing, and she’s definitely a water baby as she recently braved a chilly-looking lake with a few pals for her birthday celebrations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21526709.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_HOLBY-City-star-Rosie-Marcel-has-a-gorgeous-house-featuring-dog-sofas-neon-lights-and-a-huge-kitche.jpg><p>She sported a V-necked skintight swimming costume in black. Tina treated her Instagram followers to a glimpse of her incredible thighs as she popped out of the water to raise her arms high in the air.</p><p>She was rocking a vintage-style floral pink swimming cap as she rode the waves for some open water swimming, and later posed alongside pals wrapped in just a towel. "Then this happened... and why not!" Tina wrote alongside the photoset.</p><p>Fans including singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia rushed to share their love. The pop star wrote: "Happy Birthday!" with a love-heart emoji.</p><h3>Donna Jackson - Jaye Jacobs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234574.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-Jump-2016.jpg><p>Holby’s very own Donna Jackson, played by Jaye Jacobs, also made a name for herself in BBC school drama Waterloo Road from 2011 until 2013, as deputy headteacher Sian Diamond. She’s also appeared in everything from <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> - though she was eliminated in the second week - to <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>EastEnders</a> spin-off Perfectly Frank.</p><p>The stunning senior nurse keeps her personal life rather private, but she isn't afraid to let her hair down, and has been snapped having plenty of fun with a pal on a night out. Sporting a jaw-dropping orange, off-the-shoulder dress, Jaye flaunted her gorgeous curves in the clingy ruched number as she had a giggle along with a pal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234569.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Tina-Hobley.jpg><p>And she looked beautiful as she glammed up for an awards show, sporting a burnt orange dress with a high neck, which the star paired with dangly gold earrings. Her brunette tresses were teased into gentle waves that fell just past her shoulders, and she opted for a glam makeup look for the chic shot.</p><h3>Ange Godard - Dawn Steele</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Jaye-Jacobs.jpg><p>Scottish actress Dawn Steele is best known as Ange Godard in Holby City. But she’s also had prominent roles in BBC drama Monarch of the Glen, <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>ITV</a>’s Wild at Heart and BBC soap River City.</p><p>Like Tina, Dawn loves spending time by the water, and recently offered an intimate snap of herself posing by the sea in a stunning swimwear set. Bending down to capture the best selfie angle, Dawn’s cleavage was on full display as the wind whipped her brunette tresses around her.</p><p>The gorgeous blue sky was no match for Dawn, as she had fans absolutely gobsmacked by the stunning picture, as her swimming costume hugged her toned waist and revealed her tanned thighs. Pairing the look with some dark sunglasses, Dawn later looked introspective as she stared wistfully out onto the horizon, standing by the shore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24234586.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_TV-Choice-Awards-Arrivals.jpg><p>The mum-of-one posed with a hand on her hip as she bared her impressive body for the camera. At the time, the BBC released a statement which read: "We are incredibly proud of Holby City but it's with great sadness that we are announcing that after 23 years, the show will end on screen in March of next year.</p><p>"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities and as part of the BBC's commitment to make more programmes across the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to bring the show to a close in order to reshape the BBC's drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country."</p><p><b>For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLWwuMGyZJyhpK7Abr%2FEsaCeq6RiwLWt0axknq6Vp3pzgJFsa2ltYA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fholby-citys-sexiest-stars-ever-24234050.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./knox-county-man-faces-animal-cruelty-charge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./knox-county-man-faces-animal-cruelty-charge.html>Knox County man faces animal cruelty charge</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./coronation-streets-harriet-bibbys-glam-26922956.html>Coronation Street's Harriet Bibby's glam snaps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./coronation-streets-harriet-bibbys-glam-26922956.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
