During his appearance, he was asked about various topics, but the one of particular interest was his brother’s girlfriend, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. He was teased by the hosts about filling the post of Best Man and looked as though he wanted the ground to swallow him whole. We guess the subject of Travis Kelce and <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s potential wedding</a> really did catch him off guard.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1937285138-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-kelce-teased-about-the-possibility-of-taylor-and-travis-wedding>Jason Kelce teased about the possibility of Taylor and Travis’ wedding</h2><p>Going from the topic of Kansas City Chiefs games to Best Man speeches really caught Jason off guard, but the two hosts wanted to know if he would do one if <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> and Taylor Swift had a wedding.</p><p>“How nervous are you about this speech?” asked Adam.</p><p>A perplexed Jason replied: “What speech?”</p><p>“The best man speech,” Adam said as if it was the most obvious question in the world.</p><p>Bursting into laughter, Jason replied: “I didn’t know if you were going retirement there …”</p><p>“It’s going to be Travis and Taylor, right?” questioned the <a href=#>movie</a> maker. “Oh man, everyone’s going to be focused [on it] bro,” he laughed.</p><p>There has been a lot of speculation about the <a href=#>music</a> star and Travis taking a huge leap in their relationship. <a href=#>Whether it be them moving in together</a> or Travis putting a ring on the Love Story singer’s finger. Some insiders even suggested they had gotten engaged on New Year’s Eve – <a href=#>something we think that is bogus</a>.</p><p>“No, I just wanted to set him up because I knew he was gonna be like ‘What the hell are you talking about?'” Adam clarified.</p><p>Jason said: “Yeah, I didn’t know if you were going retirement or Best Man.”</p><p>The 36-year-old, however, didn’t give us any clues as to whether the Kelce brothers have discussed the possibility of a wedding between Travis and Taylor Swift, seemingly eager to move on from that part of the conversation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-didn-t-know-what-being-famous-was-really-like>Jason ‘didn’t know’ what being famous was really like</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1535307316-683x1024.jpg><p>Jason told the podcast hosts he wasn’t aware of what being a “pop culture” <a href=#>celebrity</a> was like.</p><p>Adam said: “Did you know what fame was -” and was cut off by the Philadelphia Eagles player giving a very firm “No.”</p><p>Adam, 37, then asked what he had learned about fame after the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> got together.</p><p>“I’ve learned that it’s crazy what it opens up opportunity-wise. It’s crazy to feel how much joy you bring people,” Jason said. “Or how you affect people’s daily lives. It also has its drawbacks, for sure.</p><p>“I mean you know more than I do,” he said to Shaq. “Travis knows way more than I do. I mean, he had to completely move out of his house right [for] safety reasons. On the first day he moved into his new house [people already knew where he was].”</p><p>He pointed out his 34-year-old brother’s home was a “gated community” which means only those who live there or have permission can access nearby.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> movie producer said the Kelce family were “lowkey” and used the charity fashion show Travis does annually as an example. Jason said they were “still learning,” and said the siblings had “always been big in the football world”. However, being a huge name in the mainstream was “a whole different level. It’s a new demographic that wasn’t there before.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eBcLbArKanZZOWu7V5x6KbnmWYnsBussCcnGavmJq7bsDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aYp5xdqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiytHnWnpudoZ6cerTBwaOcnKxdmLyusdJmrKln</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-cant-hide-his-face-when-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-subject-comes-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./5e3a81bb46163fa7968b4625-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./5e3a81bb46163fa7968b4625-html.html>NBA: Los muelles de Zion Williamson se cobran una nueva vctima de 2,13 metros</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-scully.html>James Scully</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-scully.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
