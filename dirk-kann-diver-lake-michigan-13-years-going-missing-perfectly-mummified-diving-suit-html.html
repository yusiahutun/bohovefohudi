Greg stated Dirk did not have his regulator in his mouth... Dirk was bumping into his chest, chest-to-chest, eyeball-to-eyeball,' the report read. 'Dirk's eyes were wide and big.'<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Olsen gave Mr Kann his own air supply and the two began to 'buddy breath' back and forth, but eventually, Mr Kann became completely incapacitated.<br></span></p><p><span>'He was like fading away,' the report said.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Olsen said he had two options at this point.<br></span></p><p><span>Completely out of air and holding his breath, he could rip the regulator out of his friend's mouth and continue his own ascent, or leave his friend with the air and make his way toward the surface.<br></span></p><p><span>He chose the second option. On his way up, he kept looking back for Mr Kann, hoping he would appear behind him, but he never came up.</span></p><p><span>Bottles for decompression and emergency air, tied to the point in the line where Mr Kann was last seen, were all that remained of him.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Boyd and Mr Olsen said that there was till 2,600 psi, out of a possible 3,000 psi in the tanks.</span></p><p><span>They continued to search for their friend until the U.S. Coast Guard arrived.<br></span></p><p><span>The&nbsp; Coast Guard and local law enforcement mounted an exhaustive search of the area following his disappearance, utilizing a helicopter, 41-foot patrol boat and numerous fishing vessels to assist.</span></p><p><span>Once the interview was completed, the two men asked for permission to return to the water to find their missing friend and to tell their wives of the incident.<br></span></p><p><span>Two days later, the search was called off, having only located Mr Kann's wallet, his open water diver certification and his wreck diver certification.<br></span></p><p><span>'There was a death investigation, I wouldn't call it a homicide investigation,' Sheriff Vogel said to the MailOnline. 'There were no suspicious circumstances.'</span></p><p><span>The sheriff added that a few years ago, Mr Kann's body was found by a local fisherman.</span></p><p><span>'Six, seven years ago he was snagged by a fisherman, but he was released,' he said. 'Somehow they lost the snag. We did another search for the body but couldn't find him.'</span></p><p><span>Sheriff Vogel said that each time, his office notifies the Kann family of the body's appearance.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Kann was a celebrated businessman and inventor before he passed.&nbsp; He founded a recumbent bicycle company, Linear Mfg. in Iowa during the 1980s.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>He also ran Kann Mfg, which was founded by his father, which manufactures garbage trucks, marine boats and barges.

He said the conditions would preserve a body for a long time.</span></p><p><span>'Because of the pressure and the depth it's at, there's not a long of oxygen down there,' Mr Pahnke said. 'Plus the cold, it's like a refrigerator, it'll keep for quite a while.'</span></p><p><span>The sheriff's department did not release the exact condition of the body, but reports show that Mr Kann was identified in part by the fact that he had two fingers amputated.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A flashlight with the name 'Dirk Kann' was also found on his person.<br></span></p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>video platform</a> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>video management</a> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>video solutions</a> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>video player</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcoWQcmhuZ3Sev6x5qpqlp2V0nsOmvoyFmKSdXYK2pLTIoJinZWFoerqxwKuqZp%2Bfnruoecyiqqyhnpx6sbHRn5ycrJyueq7BzKagn6GVmXqltdWipaBlo6q2tXrHraSl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdirk-kann-diver-lake-michigan-13-years-going-missing-perfectly-mummified-diving-suit-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./abbott-elementary-season-three-return-tumultuous-lisa-ann-walter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./abbott-elementary-season-three-return-tumultuous-lisa-ann-walter.html>Exclusive: Abbott Elementary season three will be 'tumultuous', says Lisa Ann Walter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./5-best-supplements-for-runners.html>5 Best Supplements For Runners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./5-best-supplements-for-runners.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
