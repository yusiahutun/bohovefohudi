Fun fact: Mike actually wasn¿t even one of the guys that the show was vetting to be in the dating pool, and ended up finding out about it through a friend of his that happened to be a producer on the show & mentioned it to him. Similar to my attitude, he decided to also not overthink it, have fun, and see what happened. Another fun fact: we both had said publicly numerous times that we would never get married again lol. so much for that. never say never! anyway, i never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would meet & fall in love with my best friend.
