The couple met at the University of Virginia, crossing paths for the first time during a<a href=#> computer science</a> class. At the time, Tiki was a sophomore, while Ginny was a freshman. The two became involved soon after and were inseparable, dating throughout college and continuing their relationship even after the NFL drafted Tiki.</p><p class=align-left>After years of dating, Ginny and Tiki Barber tied the knot on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> May 15, 1999</a>, before family and friends. The couple enjoyed several years of happiness before the marriage fell apart. They have four children together. The firstborn, Atiim <a href=# rel=noopener>Kiambu</a> Jr. (A.J.), was born in 2002.</p><p class=align-left>Two years later, they welcomed their second son, Chason Barber. They also have twin daughters, Riley and Ella Barbe, born in 2010. Ginny Cha’s twins were born after her marriage had fallen apart. In April 2010, news broke out that the couple who had been married for more than a decade were separating.

They reportedly met at NBC, and rumours are that they were cheating for a while before the scandal broke. However, Tiki and Traci maintained that they were only friends and began dating after his separation.</p><p class=align-left>A few weeks after the news of the affair broke, Ginny filed for divorce. The messy divorce proceedings continued for the next two years, the events playing out in public. There were nasty rumours about both parties, with some news outlets reporting that Tiki was lowballing his wife financially.</p><p class=align-left>In 2012, Ginny and Tikki reached a settlement, which has never been disclosed.
