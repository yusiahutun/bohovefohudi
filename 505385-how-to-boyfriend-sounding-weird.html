Contrary to the general belief that a man should make the first move, some guys are shy or afraid of rejection.</p><p class=align-left>You popping the question might be just what he needs. But how do you do it without sounding clingy or weird? Most importantly, do you know how to know when to ask someone to be your boyfriend?</p><h2>How to ask someone to be your boyfriend without sounding weird</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs20o0f5mb4ci.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ weird questions to ask your boyfriend just for fun</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Spending time with the opposite gender can be uniquely intriguing. After all, that’s how men and women start liking each other more than friends. However, sometimes, guys are oblivious to hints you’re sending.</p><p class=align-left>It can be frustrating when you reminisce about how many ways you tried to let him know that he should ask you out. So, why don’t you find a way to ask him to be your boyfriend subtly? Here are some great "Will you be my boyfriend" ideas and funny ways to ask someone to be your boyfriend to try:</p><h3>1. Ensure you’re ready for a long-term commitment</h3><p class=align-left>Before you ask someone to be your boyfriend, decide whether you are ready to be with him for a long time. Most people see the boyfriend label as an indication of long-term commitment. If you don’t want a future with him, reconsider asking them this question in the first place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275715a268e66083.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ good morning pick-up lines that'll make your crush smile</span></p></a><h3>2. Pay attention to his cues</h3><p class=align-left>Paying attention to the signs your love’s interest shows will help you easily predict his response. For example, if he hasn’t been responding to your messages lately, it might be a sign that he’s not ready, and if he texts you frequently, it may indicate his wanting to move to the next stage with you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs20o0f5mb4ci.jpg><h3>3. Pick the right time to ask</h3><p class=align-left>It can be intimidating to ask your crush to be your boyfriend, so don’t make it harder for yourself by doing it at the wrong time. For instance, immediately after a fight when tensions are high or if he’s in a stressful period with work, health, or <a href=#>family</a>. He might not be in the right mindset to consider your question properly.</p><h3>4. Ask at the right setting</h3><p class=align-left>What is a cute way to ask a boy to be your boyfriend? Being creative on when and how to ask him to be your boyfriend will be cuter if you pick the right setting. Having this conversation in person rather than over the phone is better. Invite him on a <a href=#>romantic date</a> in a quiet place and do it when you’re alone rather than in a group setting.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><h3>5. Casually slip it into the conversation</h3><p class=align-left>Take some pressure off and keep things casual. You don't have to extend a formal invitation. Instead, approach the guy subtly; that way, there's less chance of freaking him out. How do you ask someone to be your boyfriend without asking? Say something like:</p>It was getting too difficult to refer to you as the guy I've been dating for a while,' so the other day with my friends, I just referred to you as my boyfriend. Is that okay?<h3>6. Be honest about your feelings for him</h3><p class=align-left>Don’t be scared to open up about your feelings, especially if you ask formally. Instead, be vulnerable and tell the guy you’ve been feeling closer to him and want him to stay in your life. It might be scary to do this, but getting those feelings off your chest will be liberating and relieving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275715a268e66083.jpg><h3>7. Don’t freak out in case you’re rejected</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7e69dadcf886282.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to impress a girl on Instagram chat (with examples)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You may unfortunately not get the answer you were expecting. However, it doesn’t always mean no hope for the future. Maybe he’s not ready for the label yet but wants to keep dating you.</p><p class=align-left>If that’s the case, give him time to think, and you could then reassess the labels after however many weeks or months. But if it’s a no because he doesn’t feel the same way, it may hurt, but you will be okay. So accept it, and remember he is not obligated to be your boyfriend.</p><h3>8. Remember that you’re not getting married to him</h3><p class=align-left>It may be a big step to move from dating to officially a couple, but at the same time, don’t freak him out with too much asking. It’s not a marriage; you’re not locked into a contract. Mention that you’d like to see how things go as you take that road together as his girlfriend.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfb52626ba1beb41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make your angry girlfriend happy over text in 10 ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Don’t give the impression that you’re not interested in a <a href=#>long-term relationship </a>because you’ll already have established you are. Set your intentions that you’ll be together indefinitely and make clear that neither of you is locked in if you don’t end up happy together.</p><h3>9. Make your expectations clear</h3><p class=align-left>Work out what type of relationship you want. Although you'll probably do this together, thinking in advance about your needs is helpful. Will you be exclusive? And will you put your new status on social media?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/088d2e733309dc0c.jpg><p class=align-left>Will you immediately start spending more time together? Make your expectations clear. While neither of you is locked in, boundaries should still be established for you both to follow while you are together.</p><h3>10. Remember that nothing major has to change</h3><p class=align-left>Your lives don't have to change drastically because you're officially a couple. If the guy looks overwhelmed, remind him of this.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b88905e03de26a97.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayers for your boyfriend to pray every day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tell him if he's already acting like a boyfriend in various ways so he doesn't feel like he's taking on a new<a href=#> full-time job</a>. Highlight what you already love about your bond and what you may wish changes, such as exclusivity.</p><h3>11. Give him enough time to think about it</h3><p class=align-left>You may have his answer immediately after asking someone to be your boyfriend. But sometimes, the guy may need time to think about the proposal and what he wants. So don't pressure him for an answer. Instead, let him think about it until he's ready.</p><p class=align-left>You now know how to ask someone to be your boyfriend. Make the guide a must-read to avoid sounding weird the next time you want to ask a guy to be yours officially.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke also published an article about <a href=#>cute and creative ways </a>to ask a guy out on a first date. Women are empowered today; as a result, they are more likely to initiate a relationship. Many long for dating, but asking a guy you like to go out with can be frustrating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/128c18585bf81e3f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ questions girls are afraid to ask guys (deep, sensitive, funny)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is challenging to open your heart because of fear of rejection.
