To date, she tries to keep it all secret and avoids being the center of attention. After getting the Oscar nomination, talking about her nature she said,</p><p>“Because I’m small, I can hide in a big coat and I’ve got lots of hair which I use as a kind of a helmet. I’m still thrown when I am recognized.”</p><p>Along with her shyness, she suffered from dyslexia and still has it. She also said,</p><p>“It can be quite bad sometimes.
