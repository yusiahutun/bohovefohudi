Also among those in the list is Princess Diana's surprise dance number at the Royal Opera House—this, much like most of the events in the show, did happen in real life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In December 1985, Charles and Diana attended a gala performance at the storied venue. Midway through, the princess quietly left her seat in the Royal Box to grace the stage with dancer Wayne Sleep. They danced to Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl," which was Diana's own song choice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There was a gasp from the audience, of 2,500 people, who took an intake of breath all at the same time. They were speechless," Sleep recalled in a video about the performance years later.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Can you watch the performance online?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, there is no video of Diana's big dance number. (It was the '80s; people weren't going to whip out their phones to record.) And there were only a few black-and-white photos of the set taken by the opera house's photographer, which were published in 1995, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a25919017/princess-diana-kate-middleton-royal-opera-house-ballet-dance/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Town & Country" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Town & Country</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The next best thing to an actual recording is this video of Sleep in 2017, 20 years after Diana's death, in which he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmf-P0xkd9A&feature=emb_title" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="retraces the steps from the dance" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">retraces the steps from the dance</a> for CBS's 48 Hours.</p><img alt="not for use by the royal opera house, roh mandatory credit photo by reg wilsonshutterstock 251549b princess diana and wayne sleep" title="not for use by the royal opera house, roh mandatory credit photo by reg wilsonshutterstock 251549b princess diana and wayne sleep" width=2203 height=1491 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-251549b-1606142642.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Reg Wilson/Shutterstock</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did it all come together?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sleep had known the princess since the early 1980s, when she approached him for dance lessons, he revealed to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>. He couldn't teach her because he was always on tour as a professional dancer, but she later came to him again to propose their big gig. "It was all top secret," Sleep explained.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He and the princess rehearsed privately in a studio in West London. "She was in leg-warmers and a leotard," he added. "My first thought was, she's too tall to dance with me, I'll be a laughing stock: I'm 5ft 2in and she's 5ft 11in. But I soon realised she had a good sense of humour, and that we could have some fun with our height difference. She'd already decided on the music: Billy Joel's Uptown Girl."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for Diana's song choice, Sleep explained to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vulture.com/article/the-crown-princess-diana-uptown-girl-dance-wayne-sleep-interview.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vulture class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vulture</a>, "There was a music video that went with the song and she must've seen the video. There's a lovely lady with a hat—she's very chic and gets out of a car. Diana knew she could play that role of sophistication."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The night of, Sleep signaled to Diana from the wings of the stage that it was time for her to get backstage. The piece opened with Sleep but Diana made her grand entrance soon after, leaving the audience in shock. The choreography had turns, high kicks, and even a lift of sorts. Diana wasn't playing around.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did Prince Charles react?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In The Crown, Josh O'Connor's Charles is upset by this surprise, as he thinks Diana is trying to show off and upstage him. (The gala was hosted for his 37th birthday, after all.) The stunt exacerbates his already-present irritation over how well liked and popular his wife is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In real life, it's unclear exactly how the prince felt, though some accounts suggest that he was unhappy with the performance. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/11/princess-diana-uptown-girl-video-the-crown data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a>, one of Diana's biographers, Tina Brown, wrote that Charles was cool and detached after the performance. "It was embarrassingly clear that he had not been ravished by the spectacle of his wife en pointe. His disappointing response, when it leaked, was interpreted as frigid disapproval of Diana's lapse in royal etiquette."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Sleep said that things were fine, at least from his point of view at the after-party. "He had a raised eyebrow, you might say. It didn't go any further than that at the party," he told Vulture.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
