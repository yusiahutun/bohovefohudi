He is best known as the voice of Cubs games airing on TV, having worked in the club for 16 seasons. But there is more to Kasper than just his major league baseball announcement. Below is a look at his bio, from early life to career beginnings, <a href=#>family</a>, and his recent move to White Sox.</p><h2>Len Kasper profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong> Len Joseph Kasper</li><li><strong>Birthdate: </strong>January 21, 1971 (age 50)</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> Mt.

Married, dating and sexuality</span></p></a><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Len Joseph Kasper was born on January 21, 1971. He was raised in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan area. <a href=#>The star</a> attended Shepherd High School, where he was pretty active in sports. He took part in football, hockey, and basketball.</p><p class=align-left>His favourite <a href=#>sport</a> was baseball – which he stuck with it throughout his high school years. He was an excellent player and highly gifted academically. Len graduated as the valedictorian of his class.</p><p class=align-left>After high school, Kasper enrolled at Marquette University. In 1993, he graduated from the institution with a degree in public relations.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Len Kasper has enjoyed a long and successful career as a major league baseball announcer. However, it started small – as a producer in WTMJ-AM radio station. He joined the outfit immediately after graduating from college and eventually worked his way up as the station's "sports guy” on a drive-time show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8112b9a4f7f08ee2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charles Grodin: Celebrated Actor Best Known for Role in Midnight Run Dies Aged 86</span></p></a><h3>The start of his career in sports announcing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/edd6d8616df82ec1.jpg><p class=align-left>However, Kasper’s beginnings as a play-by-play baseball announcer go back further than that. Growing up in Michigan, his life revolved around Detroit Tigers. He spent much of his time idolising Alan Trammell (former MLB professional). However, his biggest idol was Ernie Harwell, the Tigers legendary announcer, whom he spent much of his childhood listening to.</p><p class=align-left>His hero worship for Harwell was so deep that he would spend his time away from school pretending to be him. It is thus no surprise that he would sway towards sports broadcasting. However, Kasper’s breakthrough did not come until 1999, when he joined the Milwaukee Brewers.</p><p class=align-left>After his funny and engaging score reading at WMTJ, the Milwaukee MLB side noticed his talent and hired him as a fill-in TV announcer. At the time, he had no experience in sports announcing, even in minor league competitions. Nevertheless, Kasper put in the work and announced a few games each year while the main announcers were unavailable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5dbb48e101cd300.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jace Norman bio: Net worth, wife, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2001, he failed to land two full-time announcer positions – with Milwaukee Brewers and Anaheim Angels. However, Kasper interviewed for another position with Florida Marlins after a vacation to the city with his family in 2002. The broadcasting officials were impressed with his talent and hired him as the TV play-by-play announcer for the club.</p><h3>Joining Chicago Cubs</h3><p class=align-left>Len Kasper remained with the Florida Marlins until the 2004 season. In 2005, he joined Chicago Cubs as their play-by-play announcer. At the club, his popularity increased due to his talent and fun and engaging announcing.</p><p class=align-left>At the Cubs, Kasper, over the years, won the club's hearts and baseball fans. In 2011, his legendary skills were recognised when he won the Sportscaster of the Year Award. The Len Kasper and Jim Deshaies partnership was especially a favourite amongst the fans. The two are even considered two of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the best broadcasters </a>in the club’s history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c048078f820f740f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Regé-Jean Page: ethnicity, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h3>Leaving for White Sox</h3><p class=align-left>In 2020, Len Kasper's contract with the Chicago Cubs ended. He had graced the club fans with excellent play-by-play commentary on TV for 16 seasons. Previously, he had received <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contract expansions </a>that had guaranteed the fans his presence for a few more years. However, this time, it was not the case; he shocked many fans when he announced that he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leaving Cubs </a>for White Sox.</p><p class=align-left>According to Kasper, the decision was spurred by his desire to be a baseball radio announcer –something he developed when he was very young. He will be joining the White Sox radio broadcasting booth for the 2021 MLB season.</p><h2>Family and relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8112b9a4f7f08ee2.jpg><p class=align-left>What is Kasper like away from the TV when announcing? Below is a look at his personal life:</p><h3>Parents and siblings</h3><p class=align-left>Len Kasper's parents are Joe and Sharon Kasper. They are a huge sports fan – especially <a href=#>football</a> and baseball- and even named him after Len Dawson, former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Kasper's parents had a massive impact on his career. He grew up listening to games on the radio.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e48f6f1b64c743d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Swaggy C: net worth, real name, big brother, Bayleigh, his TV</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In a mother’s day message, he also admitted that his mom was the one who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took and picked him</a> up from baseball practice sessions in high school. His father is also a huge Chicago Cubs fan, and he will still be cheering on the club even after he (Len) leaves for the White Sox.</p><h3>Wife and children</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Len Kasper’s wife? Does he have any children? Len Kasper is a family man who is married to Pam Kasper. Information on him is limited - there is no information on when, where, and how long they have been married. However, the couple does have a son together named Leo.</p><p class=align-left>Len Kasper lives in the Chicago area with his wife and son.
