The main thing is that she wanted a more feminine looking nose. She just wants to fix it up and give it a more feminine look."</p><p>"My main message is to just, people need to let her live, let her experience, if they know that she's doing something good or wrong, let her experience that," Vizier added. "Let her learn from it. I feel like in a way, people are still trying to control her."</p><p>The outlet noted that Blanchard's surgery is scheduled for April 5 in Lafayette, Lousiana, with Vizier adding that Blanchard will be "resting for about two weeks" following the procedure.</p><p>Blanchard has made headlines this week after she was seen out with her ex-fiancé Ken Urker following her separation from her now-estranged husband Ryan Anderson.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TMZ</strong></a>, Blanchard and Urker were spotted at a tattoo shop earlier this week, where the pair got matching dog tattoos.

"Her story, including her relationship with Ryan, will continue to unfold on Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up, debuting this June on Lifetime."</p><p>During an episode of the docuseries, she admitted that she was still talking to Urker ahead of her wedding to Anderson, and still had feelings for him.</p><p>On December 28, Blanchard served seven years out of her 10-year sentence for conspiring to kill her mom, Dee Dee Blanchard, who allegedly made her believe she suffered from many illnesses as a child, leading to several unnecessary procedures.</p><p>During her promo tour for her Lifetime docuseries, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, she has repeatedly stressed that she "regrets" her role in her mom's 2015 murder, which she plotted with her then-boyfriend Nicholas "Nick" Godejohn. Blanchard was given 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder but was released after serving just seven. Godejohn, meanwhile, was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>The murder made headlines and inspired The Act, after the bizarre details of the case began to come out. According to Gypsy Rose, her mother forced her to use a wheelchair and feeding tubes and claimed the child had numerous illnesses and disorders, including muscular dystrophy -- with doctors calling BS on those diagnoses and claiming Gypsy Rose instead suffered from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, now known as Factitious disorder imposed on another.</p><a id=gallery-link-9049b3c4-dcc4-4aad-aec6-28230c70afa1 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9049b3c4-dcc4-4aad-aec6-28230c70afa1 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:117114a7-57cc-444b-b160-61ad0c518590 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ba/4by3/2024/01/01/bac1c55018d540e6af961288b38a7cfb_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maW1fnMaxv9hmqairlWKvra3NnJ%2BaqpRiv6bCxJqjrGWXmsG1tc2gZKmkkajBqq%2BMrKyrn5WnxnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-reveals-getting-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marshall-williams-manning-meet-peyton-mannings-son.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marshall-williams-manning-meet-peyton-mannings-son.html>Marshall Williams Manning: Meet Peyton Mannings Son</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dickson-concepts-owner-harvey-nichols-department-store-looks.html>Dickson Concepts, owner of Harvey Nichols department store, looks to founders son to lead online</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dickson-concepts-owner-harvey-nichols-department-store-looks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
