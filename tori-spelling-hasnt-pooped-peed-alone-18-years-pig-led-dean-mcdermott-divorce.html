I haven't been alone ... Like honestly, I still don't poop alone,'" Spelling said. "Beau still stands there and stares and talks to me, like, while I'm pooping."</p><p>"I haven't pooped, peed alone in 18 years. First it was Dean [McDermott], then it was kids," she continued. "I think I function better with people. Is that codependent?

That is not true," Spelling said on her podcast.</p><p>"The pig was in the bed in 2017. When I was pregnant, we had a baby pig. They told me it needed to be in a bed -- that it was used to snuggling, and it needed that for a few nights," she continued. "But when it peed between us in the bed, he was like, 'The pig's leaving the bed' and I was like, 'Understood.'"</p><p>"That was the only night the pig was in the bed," Spelling added. "... The animals and kids didn't come between us in the bed."</p><p>Elsewhere during the podcast episode, the mom of five shared her thoughts on her estranged husband's new girlfriend, Lily Calo, revealing they have family dinners together.</p><p>"We do have family dinners with Dean and his girlfriend," Spelling said. "I like her a lot. I like Lily a lot. It's just different."</p><p>"I laugh when I get nervous. I make jokes when I'm nervous because I don't know how to process it," she admitted with a laugh, adding that her ex is a "very good-looking man."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:78c62654-25cb-4738-b46a-2b24d925751d data-container-ref=toofab:article:a7512021-4ed0-402c-b5e1-4e55c87c140b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6d/5by4/2024/04/01/6d99d6ebfcb54e92a3e0ec573c7f6815_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tori Spelling Reveals Dean McDermott Comment That Finally Led to Divorce Filing</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"That has never changed. I think it justâ€¦ there was so much resentment built up that I couldn't go back to that," she continued.</p><p>The former reality star went on to share that she still refers to McDermott as "babe," even in front of his new girlfriend.</p><p>"I can call him my ex-husband now? Estranged? Estranged husband? I still say babe. I always called him babe," Spelling revealed. "Like, I say 'babe' in front of his girlfriend. And I'm like, what am I supposed to call him, Dean? I have not called him Dean in 18 years. It's so weird. I guess when I get a boyfriend or someone else that I call babe, I guess I'll stop calling him babe."</p><p>Meanwhile, also during the podcast episode, she admitted that there were "moments" when she questioned her decision to end their marriage.</p><p>"I'm not gonna lie," Spelling shared. "There's moments where I'm like, 'Should I have stayed? What are the long-term ramifications on the children of staying in a marriage where they have a family, they're in the same house, it's all intact, you move fluidly, but there's so much unhappiness and so much anger? At what point is it worth it to have to have them go through that process where they're separated, and they go see different parents?'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2509ae07-b969-434a-afeb-67cdd29fe458 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a7512021-4ed0-402c-b5e1-4e55c87c140b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2024/03/14/64b9c927062f4fe29183e2badf67294c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dean McDermott Calls 'Incredible' Ex Tori Spelling His 'Biggest Supporter' During Sobriety Journey</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"And I don't know.

"The kids are seeing him again, and they're happy with his progress and the work he's done on himself. And they're proud of him, and we like his girlfriend. And we all co-parent together and living the dream. I don't know."</p><p>"You hope it works out like that. You always hope that. I don't know. I don't know what's gonna happen now. Because now it's kind of out of our hands, and it's gonna be with lawyers and courts. And I think they're not quite always used to things not getting messy with celebrities," Spelling concluded. "I don't think either of us wanted to get messy. Life's messy."</p><a id=gallery-link-ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a7512021-4ed0-402c-b5e1-4e55c87c140b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/4by3/2024/04/08/5f4de120fe8a414c8a5dc9a5efb5dc58_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXFfqbyztYysp56knJ67qHnHmqqnrF2lvLC8xJ1kqZ2VmXqiuM6nnGZpaGLGpq3RrGSpoZdiuaawjJ2cmqZdorClsdGmpq2sXZm2t7vRnJxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftori-spelling-hasnt-pooped-peed-alone-18-years-pig-led-dean-mcdermott-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./spring-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./spring-thomas.html>Who is Spring Thomas dating?
