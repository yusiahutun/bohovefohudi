<time>26 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>For any Hollywood star, making the transition from acting to directing and starring in everything from comedies to crime dramas is sure to pay off—and when it comes to <a href=#>Jason Bateman’s net worth</a>, the proof is in the pudding.</p><p>His character on Netflix’s acclaimed narcos drama, <a href=#><a href=# id=auto-tag_ozark data-tag=ozark>Ozark</a></a>, is another question. Marty Byrde’s mad descent has caused him to run into many financial troubles over the course of the series four seasons—and it’s a journey that only feels possible for viewers to stomach with an actor like Bateman behind the wheel. But long before taking on the chilling role of a cartel money launderer, Bateman—who was born in January 1969 in Rye, New York—spent years getting his start in the industry as a teen idol.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/laura-linney-net-worth.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julia-Garner.jpg><p>The actor starred in a handful of series like Simon, Chicago Songs and Some of My Best Friends before landing his breakthrough role on the sitcom <a href=#>Arrested Development</a>, where he played the shy and reserved Michael Bluth. For his role on the series, Bateman won a Golden Globe and a Satellite Award. Since then, the actor has captivated audiences dozens of times over the years, but it is his role in the Netflix original series Ozark that has really kept audiences coming back for more—and wondering how much he’s worth.</p><p>For everything we know about how much <a href=# id=auto-tag_jason-bateman data-tag=jason-bateman>Jason Bateman</a> made per episode of&nbsp;Ozark—and how much of this number accounts for Jason Bateman’s net worth overall—just keep on reading below.</p><h2>How much has Jason Bateman made from Ozark?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ozark-season-4.png><p><span>So, how much does Jason Bateman make per episode of </span><i><span>Ozark</span></i><span>? In the series, which ran for four seasons from 2017 to 2022, Bateman starred as Marty Byrde—a financial advisor who relocates his wife, Wendy Byrde, and two kids to Missouri, where the family eventually finds themselves laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel.</span></p><p>“It is working out better than I could have ever hoped for, and I had high, high hopes,” Bateman said in an interview with IndieWire of his participation in the series. “The fact that people ended up watching [‘Ozark’] is the part that you have zero control over, [but that] encourages us to keep going and make it even better and slightly more challenging,” he added at the time. “It’s been very gratifying, and it fuels me to try to take even a bigger, more challenging swing on the next project.”</p><p><span>Bateman, who also directs and executive produces Ozark, was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 2019 and has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards for his performance as Marty Bryde.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Naturally, awards like these typically translate to impressive salaries—but how much has Jason Bateman made per episode of </span><i><span>Ozark, </span></i><span>exactly</span><i><span>? </span></i><span>According to</span><a href=#> <span>Variety</span></a><span>, Bateman made around $300,000 per episode on </span><i><span>Ozark</span></i><span> as of 2017. By comparison, his co-star Laura Linney earned the same $300,000-per-episode salary at the time. Assuming their salary remained the same in following years, this means Bateman earned $3 million on </span><i><span>Ozark </span></i><span>season 1, </span><i><span>Ozark </span></i><span>season 2 and </span><i><span>Ozark </span></i><span>season 3, with every season numbering 10 episodes each. For the series’ final season, </span><i><span>Ozark </span></i><span>season 4, Bateman would have earned at least $4.2 million for 14 episodes split between Part 1 and Part 2 of the show finale.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In total, Bateman’s earnings from </span><i><span>Ozark </span></i><span>after four seasons amount to a minimum of $13.2 million for all four seasons of </span><i><span>Ozark</span></i><span>, though it’s entirely plausible that he has made even more thanks to the show’s growing success following its Emmy nominations for Outstanding Drama Series in 2019 and 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>How much did Jason Bateman make on Arrested Development?</h2><p>When Arrested Development was acquired by Netflix in 2013, the streaming giant used a sliding scale tactic to pay its actors. According to multiple sources, the Arrested&nbsp;actors were paid accordingly based on whether they received a “starring” episode or contained featured roles as appointed.</p><p>So, what did that look like in terms of Jason Bateman’s Arrested Development salary? Well, reports suggest that “starring” actors received roughly $125,00 per episode, while those who appeared in more than 90 seconds of an episode received $50,000. Meanwhile, for actors who received less than 90 seconds of airtime, they walked away with $10,000 per episode. This plan was eventually met with some <a href=# rel=nofollow>legal troubles</a> and a pay boost for the&nbsp;Arrested&nbsp;cast, but rest assured that Bateman was likely coming out on top given that he starred in more than one episode per season—earning him an easy $125,000 per episode for the majority of&nbsp;Arrested Development‘s run.</p><p>When asked if he would ever be on board for a reboot, Bateman was game; but that doesn’t mean there’s anything in the pipeline. “There are no plans to do any more at the moment. I haven’t heard about anything solid. I do know there’s a willingness to do more from all parties,” he told The New York Times in 2015. “Regardless, I hold no power over that being a reality. But speaking purely creatively, it was the best thing I’ve ever done, as far as having fun and what it did for my career.” Judging on Bateman’s net worth below, we’d have to agree!</p><h2>How else does Jason Bateman make money?</h2><p>Bateman isn’t only an actor, director and producer—the multitalented Hollywood staple has consistently contributed to voice performances, such as his role as Nick Wilde (a.k.a. the con-artist fox) in <a href=# rel=nofollow>Disney’s&nbsp;Zootopia</a>, and more. The actor also holds several property assets, including 7,000 square feet of real estate and luxury cars.</p><h2>What is Jason Bateman’s net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Јаѕоn Ваtеmаn’s net worth is $30 million as of 2022. His principal sources of income are, of course, his roles in series like Netflix’s Ozark, where he earned a reported $300,000 per episode of Ozark season one and two, at minimum. In addition, Jason Bateman’s net worth is comprised of earnings from series like&nbsp;Arrested Development,&nbsp;The Hogan Family and more.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
