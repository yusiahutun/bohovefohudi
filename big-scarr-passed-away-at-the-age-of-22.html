However, various reports have suggested that he died as a result of a drug overdose.&nbsp;On Thursday, December 22, the story went viral, and the first musician to respond was Gucci Mane, who uploaded a couple of photographs of Scarr and wrote:</p><p>“This was excruciating. I’m missing you, @bigscarr.”</p><p>Several other celebrities, like DJ Akademiks, have also responded to the news on social media. He was supposed to appear on the Key Glock Glockoma tour from March to April 2023, according to his last recent Instagram post. Scarr also said that tickets were already available for purchase.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Scarr-1.jpg alt="Big Scarr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Netizens pay homage to Big Scarr on Twitter after his tragic death.</h2><p>He was a rising star in the music business, also known as Alexander Woods, who managed to create a large audience in a short period of time.

He did, however, work on a few albums with other performers. He began his career with the track Make a Play, which was well-received by audiences despite his inexperience in the business. In 2020, the rapper signed with 1017 Records and released another song under the label, SolcyBoyz, in 2021. This was followed by the second and third portions of the single. Scarr’s debut mixtape, Big Grim Reaper, was released in April of last year. It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. Frozone, I Would Keep Goin’, Traphouse, and Joe Dirt are among his other big songs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Scarr.jpg alt="Big Scarr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also appeared as a guest on the album Love Me Like I’m Dead.

However, the year was not as successful for the hip-hop business, since it saw the loss of many outstanding musicians.&nbsp;Takeoff, who was killed last month, was the most recent victim. The event occurred at a bowling alley in Texas, and by the time police arrived, the artist had died. A nurse from a local hospital had already arrived on the scene. Two additional people had non-life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;Other names on the list include Young Slo-Be, JayDaYoungan, Rollie Bands, Money Gang Vontae, FBG Cash, Trouble, Hypo, Snootie Wild, and others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZop9dqLCivtFmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjJqenmWfm3pzfo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-lange-alleven-instant-perfector-foundation-8608634.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-lange-alleven-instant-perfector-foundation-8608634.html>Jessica Lange Wore a Foundation From a Margot Robbie-Used Brand</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./airris-is-an-airhead-mafs-viewers-criticize-airris-as-he-admits-to-not-being-attracted-to-jasmine.html>'Airris is an airhead': 'MAFS' viewers criticize Airris as he admits to not being attracted to Jasmi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./airris-is-an-airhead-mafs-viewers-criticize-airris-as-he-admits-to-not-being-attracted-to-jasmine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
