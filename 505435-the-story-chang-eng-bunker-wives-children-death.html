The duo was joined by a short, flexible band of cartilage and flesh at the sternum. Their livers were connected. Regardless, they lived normally, a life characterized by marriage and children.</p><h2>Who were Chang and Eng Bunker?</h2><p class=align-left>Chang and Eng Bunker were Siamese-American conjoined twin brothers. The duo was displayed as curiosities becoming the most studied human being in the 19th century. They were born on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 11th May 1811</a> in Samut Songkhram, Rattanakosin Kingdom.</p><p class=align-left>The duo was discovered in 1824 by Robert Hunter, a Scottish businessman. After sensing their potential to make money, he convinced them to relocate to the USA. However, it took five years to get the two out of Siam since the king forbade their departure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15cd28ad041592b5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2 Form 4 Students Suffocate Inside Cereals Silo They Had Entered to Clean</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eventually, they arrived in the USA in 1829 at 17, where they made a name and fortune for themselves by touring <a href=#>different states</a>. They performed physical feats such as swimming and somersaults during their early shows. However, they took control of their actions after touring the British Isles, learning English, and ending the initial deal with Hunter.</p><p class=align-left>Working independently, they started engaging audiences in a formal parlour setting, talking and answering questions. Finally, they gained American citizenship and settled in North Carolina. More than 15 years after leaving Siam allegedly as enslaved people, the duo bought their slave plantation.</p><p class=align-left>In 1850, more than half of Chang and Eng Bunker’s slaves were children below seven years. These kids grew up to be sold for profit or worked on the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Bunker’s plantation fields</a>.

The conjoined brother would sleep in the middle and their wives on their sides.
