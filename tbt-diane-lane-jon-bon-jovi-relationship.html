In 2017 the actress told Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen that she and the rocker dated for “five months, I was 20,” noting that “every girl should have such a wonderful experience when she’s that young."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Recalling the brief period, Lane said, “I have some photos of him packing for the tour … Just all the jockstraps were lined up on the floor for the whole band to get through the whole tour. An ocean of jockstraps.” That is some vivid imagery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Lane’s admission sparked a series of follow-ups from Cohen and fellow guest Jim Parsons, she apologized to her ex on air. “Forgive me, Jon,” she said over Cohen and Parsons’s banter. “It’s been 30 years and they’re still talking about us.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> It’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>long been rumored</a> that Lane is the red-manicured villain of Bon Jovi’s 1986 chart-topper “You Give Love a Bad Name.” Lane herself refuted the claim in 2007, laying out the facts for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Esquire</a>: “I never wear red nail polish.” Case closed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From Lane’s perspective, the split was simple, inevitable: She was 20. “Going out with somebody for five months is long when you’re 20,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Advocate</a> in 2008. “The fact that he was away and traveling on his tours was probably how we lasted so long.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bon Jovi’s former tour manager Rick Bozzett had a different take. In his memoir, Sex, Drugs and Bon Jovi, Bozzett implied that the split could be traced back to Lane’s relationship with the band’s lead guitarist, Richie Sambora.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The very thing that made Jon feel so passionate toward Diane Lane in the first place ended up being the reason for their sudden, unceremonious breakup,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bozzett wrote</a>. “Diane was young and wild and loved to party. But she loved to party so much that Jon caught her partying with Richie Sambora. That wasn’t a good day for Jon’s relationship with Diane, to say nothing of Jon-Richie relations.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lane appeared to deny Bozzett’s implication, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reportedly telling the New York Daily News</a>, "Some people will just try and sell a book, and I can't blame them. They can make up what they like. What was that line from the Cars' song, 'Let the Good Times Roll'? 'Let them say what they want, baby!’"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Deborah Feingold/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, she also admitted her memory of the relationship was “a little fuzzy,” given it had ended 25 years prior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1989, Bon Jovi told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> that his short time with Lane and the reunion with his high school sweetheart Dorothea Hurley “say everything about my career with this band.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It took us some time to find ourselves, in our personal lives as well as our career,” he explained. “So I did that. I went out and had a … whatever you want to call it. I went out with a girl for ten months, a year maybe.” It’s unclear whether Bon Jovi is referring to Lane, considering she’s said they were together for five months on multiple occasions. “You come to terms with who you are and what you’re about. That lifestyle is not for me,” he continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bon Jovi wed Hurley in 1989 and they’ve been together ever since. The longtime couple shares four children: Stephanie, 27, Jesse, 25, Jacob, 18, and Romeo, 16.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer’s 15th studio album, the aptly titled 2020, releases on Friday, Oct. 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lane married fellow actor Christopher Lambert in 1988 — they welcomed daughter Eleanor in 1993 before divorcing the following year. The actress went on to marry Josh Brolin in 2004. The actor couple split nearly a decade later, finalizing their divorce in 2013. Little is known about Lane’s current dating life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The prolific actress’s latest film, Let Him Go, in which she stars opposite Kevin Costner, comes out on Nov. 6.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT:<i> Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2acmZa7pnnLmqWeZZqku26uzqdko6emnnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qrw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-diane-lane-jon-bon-jovi-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./counting-on-jill-duggar-reveals-surprising-parenting-rules.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./counting-on-jill-duggar-reveals-surprising-parenting-rules.html>Jill Duggar reveals the surprising way she is parenting her children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./animal-song-jamal-kudu-out-lord-bobby-deols-anthem-is-finally-released-and-we-are-jumping-in-joy-1263570.html>Animal song Jamal Kudu OUT: Lord Bobby Deol's anthem is finally released and we are jumping in joy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./animal-song-jamal-kudu-out-lord-bobby-deols-anthem-is-finally-released-and-we-are-jumping-in-joy-1263570.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
