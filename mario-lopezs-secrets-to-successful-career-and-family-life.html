That could be like, ‘Dang, I’m on the other side now!'”</p><p>Approaching life with a smile has helped Mario go far. He first became a familiar face on television in the 1990s, playing A.C. Slater on the teenage comedy <a href=#>Saved by the Bell</a>. While he has continued to act, in adulthood Mario found a whole new audience as a television host. These days, he’s doing double duty as a co-host on NBC’s Access Hollywood and Access Daily. Mario is also a husband and the father of <a href=#>three school-age children</a>, Gia, Dominic and Santino.</p><p><strong>Happy birthday! Of course, they say that age is relative.</strong></p><p>“It’s funny, I was on <a href=#>The Golden Girls</a> [in 1987]. Those ladies were in their early 50s! The character of Blanche was supposed to be 47. That’s wild when I think about it. Now I’m in that age bracket!”</p><p><strong>Is this what you thought 50 would feel like?</strong></p><p>“I feel great. I still participate in very physical activities like jiujitsu boxing. It makes me feel alive; but the [slower] recovery time of my body reminds me very quickly that I’m not that young anymore.”</p><p><strong>Not every actor can also be a good TV host. How did your upbringing prepare you to tackle different kinds of performing?</strong></p><p>“When I was younger, my mom sent me to a bunch of different activities to keep me busy. I was the only dancing, theater, wrestling and karate kid. I’ve always liked to be diverse. I think it was good to do many different things, not limit myself, and create more opportunities. I am really blessed to be able to do all these different things.”</p><p><strong>Do you feel that your work ethic was instilled into you by your parents?</strong></p><p>“Absolutely. And I try to lead by example. It’s rubbed off on my kids because they’re involved in many activities. They’re hard workers.”</p><p><strong>How did you begin acting?</strong></p><p>“I just sort of fell into it, to be honest with you. It wasn’t like I didn’t want to be on TV, but <a href=#>acting</a> was just another one of my many activities. I was living in San Diego, California, and even though it’s only a couple of hours south of L.A., it’s a world of difference.”</p><p><strong>Did you ever have a mentor or someone who inspired your career path?</strong></p><p>“The person who made a significant impact on me and changed my approach toward the business was Dick Clark. I became very friendly with him after I worked with him [on the 2001 daytime talk show The Other Half]. He took me under his wing and became a mentor. That’s when I said to myself, ‘I want to do that. I want to be like Dick Clark.’”</p><p><strong>What kind of sacrifices did you have to make for your career?</strong></p><p>“Missing out on some of my kids’ activities is the biggest one. But I do coach their wrestling team.”</p><p><strong>What do you remember most fondly about your time on ‘Saved by the Bell’?</strong></p><p>“It was nice because we were actual teenagers playing teenagers. We would always shoot in summertime, which was a lot of fun. Trips to Vegas and Hawaii were personal highlights.”</p><p><strong>How did you handle all the attention as a teenager? Was fame difficult on you?</strong></p><p>“Not really. There wasn’t any social media back then, thank goodness, so it wasn’t as saturated. I got to go to a regular high school and experience sports, prom and homecoming. It was great.”</p><p><strong>Is there anything you know now that you wish you knew as a young performer?</strong></p><p>“Yes — that I can take my time.”</p><p><strong>You’re Catholic and have been very open about going to church and believing in the power of prayer. Is this just a natural extension of who you are as a person?</strong></p><p>“I never talk about politics, even though I know that’s very popular with lots of people in entertainment, because I don’t want to alienate anyone. I don’t want to give them a reason to change the channel. I believe people should do what’s best for themselves and their family. But I do speak on my faith, because I’m very proud of it. I’m not trying to influence someone one way or the other, I’m just being honest about how I feel. I’ve been surprised by the positive response.”</p><p><strong>You’ve been married to your wife, Courtney Laine Mazza, since 2012. What’s your secret for a happy marriage?</strong></p><p>“It’s no secret — I’ve got a great partner. Courtney’s awesome! She gets me. That’s one of our most essential things as partners and parents. We understand each other and try to make each other better.”</p><p><strong>What do you like most about being the age you are today?</strong></p><p>“I feel very settled. I’m fortunate to be where I am, both professionally and personally, and I have great kids.”</p><p><strong>What is your typical day like?</strong></p><p>“My day starts with getting the kids ready for school. Then, I usually go and do jiujitsu. I’m sequestered at Universal Studios for the rest of the day. I do a nationally syndicated radio show called On With Mario Lopez, which is also taped. From there, I film Access Hollywood, my nighttime entertainment show, followed by Access Daily, the daytime version. That’s all three, every day, Monday to Friday.”</p><p><strong>That’s a lot to keep you busy!</strong></p><p>“I also have a podcast called The 3 Knockdown Rule and I’m producing and hosting A Blank Slate for the Game Show Network. I also recently did a documentary on HBO with my buddy <a href=#><strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong></a> called The Golden Boy. I’m busy, busy, busy!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhn2K5sLzEs6pmq5WYv6bA0marqGWjqrCksdKsna6kXZius7HEq2SappRis6K5yKWwZqSZm7Jw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmario-lopezs-secrets-to-successful-career-and-family-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./miranda-lamberts-muttnation-foundation-awards-grant-money-and-offers-emergency-relief-following-extreme-weather.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./miranda-lamberts-muttnation-foundation-awards-grant-money-and-offers-emergency-relief-following-extreme-weather.html>Miranda Lamberts MuttNation Foundation Awards Grant Money And Offers Emergency Relief Following E</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-kirk-age-height-net-worth-married-wife-children-bio-wiki.html>Justin Kirk Age, Height, Net Worth, Married, Wife, Children, Bio &amp;amp; Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-kirk-age-height-net-worth-married-wife-children-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
