Fans slammed the new groom after he admitted to having no physical attraction to his wife.</p><p>'<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MAFS</a>' star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Airris</a> has revealed his "internal battle" with Jasmine and why he was moving cautiously with her physically during their honeymoon. Airris, a 39-year-old software programmer dubbed "Reformed and Ready for Love" by Lifetime, was paired to marry Jasmine, a 31-year-old cheerleading instructor and beauty queen nicknamed "Queen Without a King," on the show's currently airing Nashville season. While Airris and Jasmine had a wonderful ceremony and started their marriage off on the right foot, Airris found himself holding back during their honeymoon in Jamaica. While Airris led Jasmine to think he was repressing his strong sexual desire in order for them to get to know each other on a deeper level first, there was more to it.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'There's been nothing romantic': 'MAFS' Season 16 star Gina gets emotional as Pastor Cal asks if she wants a divorce</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Harping on the wrong things': 'MAFS' fans slam Domynique for whining about Mackinley not signing lease</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/60d480b8-4a51-4b88-b534-4286127073b8.png><h2 class=split>'Why don’t I feel the same way?' wonders Airris</h2><p>As previously seen, Airris and the Black beauty queen were not romantically involved in Jamaica, despite Airris confessing that his petite wife Jasmine is not his type. Airris, who favors butts like Serena Williams' and Megan Thee Stallion's, informed the 'MAFS' husbands that his degree of attraction to her is a 4 while "hers is a 12."</p><p>"I feel like we both are here for the same reason, I just kind of wanted you to be aware of where my head is because it’s been kind of stressing me out," said Airris to Jasmine while confessing his true feelings. "Right now I feel more of like a friendly vibe. […] ” just need time to get there I’m just hoping like you said you’ll give me grace."</p><p>Pastor Cal has arrived to advise the pair while also observing whether sparks can still flow between them. In tonight's episode, Airris and Jasmine meet with the 'MAFS' expert at their house, who asks them for a report on their marriage after the honeymoon. Jasmine tells Pastor Cal that she wanted her spouse to be drawn to her and "rip her clothes off," and Airris confesses that they weren't on the same page.</p><p>"I was feeling almost like guilty, almost like you know why don’t I feel the same way?" states Airris. "Normally it’s like the other way around, I’m a very sexual person. Normal, single me I’m on the balcony going crazy, it’s secluded like I’m making an R&B video in this bathroom but my mind wasn’t there."</p><p>Pastor Cal informs Airris that he is overthinking things. "This is your marriage," speaks Pastor Cal. “You can make this whatever you want to make it or you can destroy it based on how you think and what you tell yourself."</p><p>Pastor Cal is also concerned about how the 'MAFS' procedure is impacting the software developer. "I’m wondering how much of your feelings have to do with this whole process because it’s a lot," expresses Pastor Cal. “I know quite often, especially for strong people it’s like I don’t want nobody telling me what to do, I don’t want anybody to put me in no situation where I gotta perform, and sometimes that can kind of shut you down."</p><p>He then requests Jasmine to tell Airris what she enjoys about him, and she praises him for his honesty, work ethic, and ability to make her feel at ease.</p><p>"How does it make you feel to hear her say that?" questions Pastor Cal.</p><p>"It makes me feel good like I’m doing some things right," voices Airris. "I feel like it’s a solid foundation like we have something to build off of."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b222020e-3884-45be-bafe-265422abc5d5.png><h2 class=split>'Airris just wants a girl with a big butt'</h2><p>Slamming Airris a fan wrote, "Airris can’t get past the nose and teeth…" Another fan quipped, "Airris would be attracted to Jasmine if she wasn't into him." Giving him the taste of reality, a fan wrote, "Airris really thinks he’s this fine ass Mf & he’s really not LMFAOOO." Fans also feel Pastor Cal wants the marriage to work more than Airris himself, "Pastor Cal wants these marriages to work way more than any of the women — and Airris."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Airris really thinks he’s this fine ass Mf & he’s really not LMFAOOO <a href=#>#MAFS</a></p>— 1205✨ (@itsjayymacc) <a href=#>February 23, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>One fan also raised a question, "Airris was clapping when Jasmine walked down the aisle.... But now he isn't attracted to her... Maybe it's her personality." Trying to make sense why Airris friendzoned Jasmine, a viewer tweeted, "I'm starting to think Airris is use to “dating” ugly ducklings and Jasmine is pretty and he sort of doesn’t know how to handle that as to why he friend zoned her." Calling him an airhead, a fan wrote, "#Airris is an airhead. He notices #Jasmine’s great qualities but he’s stuck on ‘a certain’ external and not both her internal & external beauty." One other person slammed him saying, "Airris just wants a girl with a big butt. Don’t tell her she’s attractive and has a good heart but you not into her."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Airris was clapping when Jasmine walked down the aisle.... But now he isn't attracted to her...
