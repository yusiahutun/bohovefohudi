Who is Chris Smoove’s girlfriend?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Chris Smoove is a YouTube gaming influencer who is known for his tagline: “There’s strong, and then there’s Army Strong! There’s smooth, and then there’s Chris Smoove!”</p><p>Known for his signature autotunes and his “splash” signature phrase, Chris Smoove has racked up over 5 million subscribers and a mind-blowing 3.4 billion video views to his channel.</p><p>Fans and followers can catch Chris Smoove on his channel every week, where he uploads his gameplay and gaming commentary in <a href=# rel=noopener>NBA 2K</a>, Need for Speed, 2K19, Madden, Call of Duty…and the list goes on.</p><p>To make his channel even more engaging for his followers, Smoove has invited pro athletes—big names like John Wall, David Ortiz, and Tony Parker—to join him in his live streams.</p><p>When he’s not streaming his gameplay and video game commentary, he’s uploading commentary on real-life NBA highlights.</p><p>Known for his passionate critique and how open he is with his opinions and feelings on the game, Smoove has steadily built a strong and loyal following on YouTube.</p><p>So, what’s next for the Smoove guy on the video-sharing platform? And what do we know about how he got here.</p><p>Let’s find out.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Smoove was born on the 27th of November, 1989, in South Florida.</p><p>On August 22nd, 2014, he posted a video of him performing the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge with his girlfriend—but he very rarely talks about his personal life.</p><p>Much like how he kept his face hidden from fans for years (more on that in a minute), Smoove hasn’t shared anything about his family or his childhood.</p><p>What we do know is that he created a YouTube account for the same reason most teenage boys do.</p><h2><strong>The Start Of Something Good</strong></h2><p>Initially, he joined YouTube to look at videos of girls shaking their booties, but over time he started to realize that maybe he also had something to offer.</p><p>At the start of February 2008, he created a short basic tutorial on how to spin, move, and jump on NBA 2K.</p><p>His channel—initially named Smoove7182954—didn’t get a lot of views in the beginning.</p><p>Over time, as Chris Smoove started to develop his own persona and find his own style on social media, his viewers started to sit up and pay attention.</p><p>He began sharing more content and adding game commentary to his walkthroughs and gameplay.</p><p>This helped the young Florida native to build a more engaged fan base.</p><p>Early on in his YouTube career, Smoove didn’t show his face on camera.</p><p>After a while, fans began to question why he was so camera-shy, with Reddit threads and YouTube comments dedicated to answering that question.</p><p>It wouldn’t be until November of 2012 that he would finally appear on camera himself, more than 4 years after he’d launched his career.</p><p>When that happened, though, his fans weren’t really paying attention to him.</p><p>That’s because the video was a collaboration with NBL player—and former Mr. Eva Longoria—Tony Parker.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-40584 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eva-Longoria-and-Tony-Parker.jpg.webp alt=" Eva Longoria and Tony Parker " width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eva-Longoria-and-Tony-Parker.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-40584 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty Images</p><p>Parker’s appearance in the video caused it to go viral, and by 2021 their collaboration—titled Tony Parker vs. Chris Smoove – Need for Speed Most Wanted NFS01—had received 5.4 million views.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kirsten Powers & Robert Draper</a></p><h2><strong>A Brush With The Big Leagues</strong></h2><p>Tony Parker wouldn’t be the last of the superstar pro athletes to appear on Chris Smoove’s channel.</p><p>Amongst his hilarious commentary in NBA 2K, Madden, and CoD, we’ve also found promo gems for Play Station 4, which feature some of the biggest names in pro sports.</p><p>Names like John Wall, the 2010 NBA Draft’s first overall pick after playing just one year of college ball for the Kentucky Wildcats.</p><p>The five-time NBA All-Star keeps company in Smoove’s PS4 promo with David Ortiz.</p><p>Ortiz—also known as David Americo Ortiz Arias, or Big Papi, depending on who you talk to—is a Dominicano and former pro baseballer with 20 seasons of MLB under his belt.</p><p>He played 14 seasons with the Boston Red Sox and was a ten-time All-Star and three-time World Series champ.</p><p>Not bad company for a young kid from the Sunshine State to be keeping.</p><p>In 2010, Smoove also secured a partnership with video entertainment giant, Machinima.</p><p>He was the recipient of their Machinima Sports Best Commentary award. He was also nominated in the Gaming category for the 11th Annual Shorty Awards.</p><h2><strong>What He Plays</strong></h2><p>Throughout his career as a gamer—who knew that was a career path?—he’s gone on camera to play a plethora of games, including:</p><ul><li>The NBA series—NBA 2K, NBA 2K16, NBA 2K17</li><li>The Call of Duty series</li><li>The Madden series</li><li>The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt</li><li>FIFA 13</li><li>Assassin’s Creed 3</li><li>Sniper Elite 4</li><li>Watch Dogs 2</li><li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li><li>Grand Theft Auto</li></ul><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Darin Olien Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Wife/Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Chris Smoove is not married.
