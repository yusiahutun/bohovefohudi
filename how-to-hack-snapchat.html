However, with increased security and privacy fears, you're likely looking for ways to secure your account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wondering how to hack into someone's Snapchat account? Well, we won't be doing a tutorial for that, as it's illegal. Instead, we'll inform you about the methods used by Snapchat hackers and how to protect your account.</p><p>So, how can someone hack into your Snapchat account? And how can you protect your public profile from cybercriminals?</p><h2 id=how-attackers-hack-someone-39-s-snapchat-account>How Attackers Hack Someone's Snapchat Account</h2><p>Snapchat is popular due to its short-lived content; this is why it may seem like an unsuspecting platform for hackers. As a Snapchat user, you might even be curious as to why someone would hack Snapchat.</p><p>Cybercriminals hack Snapchat accounts for various reasons, including illegal spying, blackmailing, and obtaining private information like your phone number and passwords.</p><p>Here are seven common methods these cybercriminals employ to hack Snapchat accounts.</p><h3 id=downloading-spyware-and-keylogger-apps>1. Downloading Spyware and Keylogger Apps</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cyber-Security-Illustration.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hackers use <a href=#>monitoring tools called spyware</a> to spy on someone's Snapchat account. This is the most widely used method of spying on social media.</p><p>After installation, spyware apps, like mSpy, can remain hidden on your device and record your activities in real-time. This allows the hacker to view your activity—and archive it—on Snapchat. Besides, such tools help attackers to read, archive, and screenshot messages, photos, and videos.</p><p>Most times, you won't be able to tell if a bad actor has installed spyware on your device because these apps operate discreetly. However, there may be strange text messages on your device, unfamiliar apps and files, a hike in your data usage, and signs of malfunction.</p><p>If you're suspicious, you can purchase spyware removal tools from reputable brands like Avast and Kaspersky and scan your device. Alternatively, you can boot your device into Safe Mode</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another widely used method of getting into someone's account is by using keyloggers. A keylogger is a tool that tracks every keystroke made by a user. In other words, by using a keylogger, one can record whatever text you type with your keyboard.</p><p>Note that hackers can set up keyloggers on your devices and quickly get your account ID and password if you don't use a password manager. All this sounds scary, but don't worry; we know some <a href=#>ways to protect your data from keyloggers</a>.</p><h3 id=third-party-data-leaks>2. Third-Party Data Leaks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/haveibeenpwned-dot-com.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since monitoring apps can record and store the data they track from Snapchat, content that you later delete may have already been copied. When such monitoring apps face data leaks, all the confidential information, such as your login ID and password, becomes available on the internet. Then, anyone can use that information and get into your account.</p><p>It's wise to check third-party data leaks to be safe. You can visit the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">haveibeenpwned.com</a> website and enter your email address or phone number to see if you have been affected by a data breach.</p><h3 id=using-hacking-websites>3. Using Hacking Websites</h3><p>Some websites claim to provide tools that can access users' Snapchat accounts. Such websites ask for the Snapchat username of the targeted user.</p><p>This easy-to-use and, most times, free method is an attractive option for hackers who do not have access to devices or passwords to get into a Snapchat account. These online services claim to provide advanced tools that do the rest of the work.</p><p>Now, you might wonder if a Snapchat account can be hacked simply by going to a hacking website. Even though these hacking websites assert their legitimacy, they typically aren't legitimate or effective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=phishing>4. Phishing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hacking-Site-Illustration.jpg><p>Above all, <a href=#>hackers use advanced phishing techniques</a> to create fake websites to trap unsuspecting people. These fake websites are known as phishing pages and seem identical to the official Snapchat site.</p><p>When victims enter their login credentials, the hackers collect their credentials and hack them after some time. This is because they mistakenly provide their passwords to the hackers, thinking they've entered the details on the official website. If you've somehow fallen into such a trap, you need to know <a href=#>what to do after a phishing attack</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Examining the URL of a website is a straightforward way to spot a phishing page. If the URL contains deceptive words or ends in a non- .com domain, be aware and don't enter any details on such web pages. Also, <a href=#>enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> is a great way to supplement your password; it ensures that hackers don't take over your accounts even if your password is compromised.</p><h3 id=working-with-a-hacker>5. Working With a Hacker</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Hacker.jpg><p>A hacker can target your Snapchat account to learn more about you and potentially blackmail you, or they might be hired (probably by someone you know) to access your account.</p><p>Wondering if someone can hack your device through Snapchat? Well, the simple answer is no. Simply accessing your Snapchat account won't allow someone to access and control your device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, hackers with access to your Snapchat account are a step closer to taking over your device. If you reuse passwords, which you shouldn't, access to your Snapchat account can open doors to several other online accounts of yours.</p><h3 id=brute-force-attacks>6. Brute Force Attacks</h3><p><a href=#>A brute force attack is a common hacking method</a> in which an attacker bombards a login page with thousands of different passwords until it finds the correct one and logs you in. Basic or easy-to-guess passwords like "abcd123" or "123456" are among the first to be tested, so they are decoded in just a few seconds.</p><p>This kind of hacking is similar to a robber breaking into a safe by attempting all the lock's numbers. A brute force attack can almost instantly crack a weak or common Snapchat password. This is the reason we always recommend <a href=#>using a good password generator</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=using-wireless-sniffing>7. Using Wireless Sniffing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wireless-Sniffing-Illustration.jpg><p>Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but risky. Hackers can access a wireless network, such as public Wi-Fi, and begin intercepting every bit of data sent across the network in order to acquire your Snapchat password.</p><p>Of course, this isn't restricted to passwords. The hacker can also target your private information, such as credit card numbers, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, and so on. If you're using public Wi-Fi, we recommend <a href=#>using a secure VPN</a> to protect your privacy.</p><h2 id=how-to-protect-your-snapchat-account>How to Protect Your Snapchat Account</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pexels-sanket-mishra-17888111.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're not particularly famous or a public figure, you might think, “why would someone hack my Snapchat?” Well, hackers are well aware of how useful passwords and data are. Moreover, Snapchat hackers could lock you out of your account and hassle your friends and family.</p><p>For instance, in March 2023, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Attorney's Office announced</a> the sentencing of a man who hacked a female soldier's account, locked her out, requested loans from her friends, sold her private images, and used her account to obtain other usernames and passwords. And there have been several cases like this one.</p><p>You have to secure your Snapchat account before it's too late. Based on the methods used by hackers, here are a few simple tips to secure your account:</p><ul><li><strong>Verify the phone number and email address related to your Snapchat account to keep it secure.</strong></li><li><strong>Choose a strong password for your Snapchat account.</strong> It should be a mix of characters that do not include personal information; it must differ from your other accounts, and you should keep it private.</li><li><strong>Check your account's privacy settings. </strong>This allows you to control who views your stories, sends you Snaps, and can see your location. This can prevent people from finding out your username.</li><li><strong>You should only add actual friends to your contact list. </strong>Don't link up with strangers. It might seem fun and frivolous, but it's not worth risking your security and privacy.</li><li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication to restrict access to your account.</strong> This feature ensures the person logging in is indeed you.</li><li><strong>Keep your devices updated</strong>. If hackers jailbreak your phone to install spyware, an operating system (OS) update may remove these apps, as they are typically unauthorized. Don't forget to use good antivirus software to scan and protect your devices.</li><li><strong>Keep your devices safe</strong>. Don't leave your smartphone out of sight or with people you don't trust. Also, you can employ biometric security to ensure that it's harder for cybercriminals to get into your devices. It's also a smart move to turn on 2FA for app installation.</li><li><strong>Exercise caution online</strong>. Be careful when clicking links. If you're using a web browser, it's a good idea to <a href=#>hover over the URLs before clicking</a>, so you don't mistakenly download malware or offer hackers your data.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These tips should help keep your account safe from hackers. If you believe your Snapchat account has been hacked, you should contact <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapchat Support</a> immediately.</p><h2 id=stop-hackers-from-accessing-your-snapchat>Stop Hackers From Accessing Your Snapchat</h2><p>Now that you know how hackers can get into your Snapchat account, it's your turn to make the right moves and prevent the next Snapchat hack.
