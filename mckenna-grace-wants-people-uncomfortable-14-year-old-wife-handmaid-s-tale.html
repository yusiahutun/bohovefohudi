It's something she felt was important to know about the character, just as she felt it important that someone her age bring Mrs. Keyes to life.</p><p>"It meant a lot that I got to actually play the age Mrs. Keyes is," she told the outlet. "I did think it was important for an actual 14-year-old to play the role, especially since this 14-year-old is being raped and abused and sold off, all of these things that are happening to 14-year-olds every single day."</p><p>Spoiler alert for anyone who has not yet watched the season premiere episodes. In those installments, Mrs. Keyes opens up to June about her husband having other men come into their home and rape her, not to mention that she was effectively given to him as a wife under this dystopic version of America's (now Gilead) patriarchal government.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bda78fa8-014e-57cf-b297-19a529248cc8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:64eff204-fd8c-4b5e-923e-7f4b4462e0c8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2018/08/29/33cd8f01e0335ebfafbbe0a0baf8a42c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Captain Marvel' Star Mckenna Grace Geeked Out Meeting Brie Larson on Set</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The whole story of "The Handmaid's Tale" is about the subjugation of women, who lose all status and rights after a dramatic government overthrow in a world where fertility rates have dipped dangerously low. Handmaids are for breeding only, and treated like property, but Mrs. Keyes reminds June that it's not always easy to be a Wife, either.</p><p>In a harrowing scene we mercifully do not see, Grace's Mrs. Keyes gets an opportunity to exact revenge on one of the men who'd had his way with her. But we do see the aftermath. Her character is sad and angry and broken and a little twisted as a result, but Grace plays it so effectively.</p><p>And yes, it is startling to see and hear a 14-year-old saying such horrific lines and acting out such darkness, but even that, Grace feels, is important. She wants people to squirm and cringe and feel that there's something almost inappropriate about her playing this role.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:da096b98-3c36-435e-8908-fc0310223209 data-container-ref=toofab:article:64eff204-fd8c-4b5e-923e-7f4b4462e0c8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/5by4/2021/04/28/c5d6f16f086149b4ba47c1cc9ab48f02_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Holly Madison Reveals 'Truth' About Girls Next Door, Slams EP's 'Completely Untrue' Claims</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"If it makes people upset or uncomfortable that an actual 14-year-old is having to talk about how she was raped and it’s acting, then maybe that will make you want to do something for actual girls who are going through this," she said pointedly.</p><p>She said that Moss has been a big help with her in some of those more challenging scenes. She recalled meeting up with Moss and the episode director for the scene where she first opens up about having been raped over and over again by different men.</p><p>She said Moss had them go over that scene several times, wanting to make sure Grace was comfortable with the awful things her character opened up about. But Grace says the discomfort of it is what "makes the scene so great, because it needs to be talked about."</p><p>She reiterated that girls her age are still getting married off. "Technically, I could get married if my mom or dad or my legal guardian signed a document for me. That kind of Gilead stuff, it happens every day, even though we’re not living in a 'Handmaid’s Tale' situation. It's just much more quiet."</p><a id=gallery-link-bcefb7c8-b5a9-4eca-99fa-de96b68553f8 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bcefb7c8-b5a9-4eca-99fa-de96b68553f8 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:64eff204-fd8c-4b5e-923e-7f4b4462e0c8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/4by3/2021/04/26/2e931ddb74f84435965165468450154c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21ma3FforCssc2nmGafopawpnnWmqWtq12lsrC8y55krqaTpLqnu9GtmJuklWJ%2BdXnYnpirZZ%2BhsW7DyJ%2BcZqCRo7GurcidZKxlpJa5pns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmckenna-grace-wants-people-uncomfortable-14-year-old-wife-handmaid-s-tale.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-lefsetz-letter-taylor-swift-tickets-available.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-lefsetz-letter-taylor-swift-tickets-available.html>The Lefsetz Letter: Taylor Swift Tickets Available!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./home-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Home Alone 2 Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./home-alone-2-cast-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
