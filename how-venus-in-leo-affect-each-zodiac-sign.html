<time>13 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Put your favorite party dress on! The goddess of love is making its annual debut via the festive sign of Leo, and it’s giving us all the more reason to celebrate. What are you most proud of? What makes you stand out in the crowd? Charismatic and sparkling with self-confidence, you’ll be surprised to learn <a href=#>how Venus in Leo 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a>. Not only will it station retrograde from July to September, but this transit will also trigger significant breakthroughs in the process. With that said, you’ll definitely want to make note of where this fixed fire sign lives in your chart, as there will be greater emphasis on this area of your life. After all, there’s nothing Venus in Leo loves more than public displays of affection.</span></p><p><span>Also known as the <a href=#>planet of abundance, beauty, love and values</a>, Venusian transits never cease to bring in the sweetness, but the goddess’ love language depends on the sign it’s transiting. For example, upon slipping into intuitive Cancer on May 7, Venus took a deep dive into its cardinal waters, where she became more in tune with the emotional undercurrents that surround her intimate partnerships. Finances are no exception, as this transit could’ve also shed a light on the fluctuating dynamics of our spending habits, as well as the unconscious memories that may have influenced one’s <a href=#>relationship with money</a>. All in all, this Venusian transit collectively encouraged us to cultivate self-love, and trust our intuition.</span></p><p><span>Ready or not, it’s time to come out of your shell! Venus will conclude its journey <a href=#>through sentimental Cancer</a> on June 5, as it will make a grand entrance via the cinematic sign of Leo. Strike a pose! Vivacious, extravagant and unapologetically flashy, Venus in Leo will turn up the heat in our relationships, as it will spice things up in more ways than one. See, in addition to its ravenous desire for affection and praise, this transit makes us more confident and dramatic in the pursuit of our heart’s desires. To say Venus in Leo is romantic would be an understatement, as its celestial persona is equally as childlike as it is heart-centered. Creativity is also at an all-time high… so by all means, let your muse be your guide.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/whataleolookslike.png><p><span>A big fan of the royal treatment, it’s important to be mindful of our show-stopping gestures and extravagant spending habits while Venus takes the stage in Leo. Nothing wrong with embodying authenticity and self-confidence, but the ego tends to take the lead. On another note, specifically when considering the shadowy attributes of this sassy transit, Venus in Leo’s relentless passions could easily result in competitive relationship dynamics, and/or the need to one-up a lover for the sake of the potential theatrics. Truth be told, there’s nothing Venus in Leo wouldn’t do to prove a point… and <a href=#>with Mars also in the mix</a>, it’s no holds barred.</span></p><p><span>Upon activating Leo’s fixed fires, Venus will make a direct opposition to <a href=#>Pluto retrograde in Aquarius</a>, which can be just as enlightening as it is overwhelming. For instance, whether financially, romantically or in terms of our core values, this transit could bring awareness to unconscious power dynamics, as well as fears surrounding authenticity and/or your heart’s desires. Similarly, if you’re surrounded by individuals who aren’t in support of your unique talents, skills and abilities, this could bring a much-needed breakthrough. Venus will eventually square Jupiter, Uranus and the North Node and this could, in turn, highlight the areas where we’ve been lacking the courage to venture out of our comfort zones.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>Venus will dance through passionate and prideful Leo from June 5 to October 8.</p></figure><p><span>Last but certainly not least, the planet of love will <a href=#>begin its retrograde journey</a> via 28 degrees of Leo on July 22 before going direct—via eight degrees of this fixed fire sign—on September 13. Retrograde cycles are more than often frowned upon for causing delays in our personal lives, but there’s always a silver lining. For instance, in the case of sweet Venus—a planet that governs everything from our sense of self worth to our money-making abilities—its retrograde journey through Leo will present us with an opportunity to take a step back, and reflect on what we believe is truly authentic in our lives.</span></p><p><span>This could be <a href=#>a romantic partnership</a>, or perhaps even a creative collaboration you’ve been exploring. Whatever the case may be, Venus retrograde is slowing down so we can revisit, reflect and reassess the value of our personal investments. In the meantime, reflect on the following questions: Does it bring you and your inner child joy? Are you being celebrated, compensated and/or recognized for the value you bring? Are you in touch with your authenticity and unique attributes? How can you share more of your light with the rest of the world? Is there a passion project you’d like to revisit? Have you explored ways to capitalize on your creativity?</span></p><p><span>Here’s how Venus in Leo will affect you, based on <a href=#>your sun sign</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a> :</span> <b></b></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3367129135539><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Grab your favorite childhood photo, and create an altar for your inner child. Otherwise, when was the last time you enjoyed a celebratory night out? The planet of love is pirouetting through your heart-centered fifth house of authenticity, creativity and self-expression, which means it’s time to put your talents on display. (Not to worry; you won’t have to try very hard.) You’re a magnet for praise and affection this Venusian season, and your theatrical persona makes you all the more irresistible. (To think your red-hot ruler, Mars, is also charging up this area of your chart!) As for Venus retrograde, you’ll want to make note of your creative ideas and inspirations between July and September. BTW, romantic flings from the past are also likely to resurface, so keep your head held high and show ‘em what they’ve been missing. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8212407991588><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Home is where both your heart and the party is, so call up your best pals ‘cause you’re the host with the most. This is also an excellent transit for family gatherings, and fun-filled activities that bring you and your loved ones together. Now, in addition to having your celestial ruler, Venus, sweetening things up in your humble abode, you also have feisty Mars adding wood to the fire. Those of you entertaining the thought of re-adorning your living space, don’t hesitate to take the creative lead, as long you’re being mindful of your spending. Venus retrograde will be especially significant for you, given that Venus just so happens to be your planetary ruler, not to mention retrograding through the most personal sector in your chart. Themes surrounding family assets, childhood heirlooms and/or your close relatives could come up for review. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.340625><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>It’s hard to use your indoor voice when both Mars and Venus are in Leo, let alone igniting your chatty third house of communication. Fortunately, there’s nothing you enjoy more than dynamic storytelling and… well, the tea will be scorching hot now that the planet of love is dazzling this area of your chart. Whether via Instagram DMs with your crush, or in the breakroom with your favorite co-workers, there’s no denying your theatrical and charismatic persona. You’re already a brilliant conversationalist, so go on and take the mic. Keep in mind, between July and September, Venus retrograde will likely inspire you with an influx of ideas, whether creatively or with regards to your personal life. You’re naturally fickle, but it can be difficult to stay present at this time. Make sure you’re communicating clearly and penciling in your miscellanies. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3724544480171><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Remember who you are, and don’t be afraid to prioritize your personal values. You are worth more than you give yourself credit for. Although, whether for better or for worse, your relationship with money and your sense of self-worth are being brought to the forefront at this time. This is especially true with Venus making its regal debut in Leo, and your stability-seeking second house of money, finances and possessions. Feeling the urge to splurge? Venus already craves the finer things, but the glitz and glamour tends to go up a notch (or two) when transiting lavish Leo. Moreover, Venus will backspin through this area of your chart between July and September, which is where you could be confronted with a new-found awareness around finances and/or your sense of security in general.

In addition to having both Mars and now Venus in your sign, your ruler (the sun) is also lighting up your 11th house of social contributions, and sense of belonging in the world. Reflect on your personal branding and unique identity. After all, you’re more likely to connect with potential suitors under this dazzling transit, whether for personal or professional reasons. More importantly, Venus will retrograde in your sign between July and September, and no this doesn’t put a damper on your birthday festivities.

Lady Venus will be joining go-getter Mars in Leo—via your sleepy 12th house of closure, inhibitions and unconscious patterns—which presents you with an opportunity to get reacquainted with your personal life behind the scenes. And though you’re compassionate by nature, it’s important to be discerning when it comes to the sacrifices you consciously and/or unconsciously choose to make. This is also a wonderful time to check-in with yourself, and bask in some well-deserved alone time. Activities where you can reconnect with your zen (a day at the spa, meditation, yoga, etc.) are suggested. Venus will eventually station retrograde, and this could bring awareness to relationship patterns you unknowingly subscribed to, while others of you find the will to surrender a romantic partnership once and for all. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8249227600412><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>Your social media content is poppin’ but then again, it’s hard not to double-tap when you’re Venusian and irresistible. Also, it’s not everyday your luscious planetary ruler sashays through your 11th house of soirées, friendship and social contributions. You’re living it up, and showing the world the true story of a sparkling socialite. Mars is also igniting this area of your chart, which means if you’re suddenly crushing or craving romantic attention from an acquaintance, it’s bound to fizzle as quickly as it starts. On July 22, your goddess ruler will station retrograde, which is where things are bound to get interesting. For example, if you’ve been surrounding yourself with superficial energies who aren’t genuinely supportive of your unique talents, or simply not in alignment with your future goals and aspirations, the truth will be crystal clear. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2758620689655><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Spruce up your LinkedIn profile, and restock those business cards! Venus will be joining your co-ruler, Mars, via the show-stopping sign of Leo, and your 10th house of authority, reputation and legacy in the world. Whether professionally or in terms of finances, Venus brings out the best in you, as you are equally as diplomatic as you are celebrated for your work ethic at this time. This is when the stars align for a well-deserved promotion, while others may send out resumes in hopes of landing the job of your dreams. The irony of this glow-up, however, is that Venus will eventually station retrograde in this area of your chart, but this doesn’t take away from its appeal. In fact, if you were contemplating whether to launch your own business, or perhaps connect with a mentor that could help you level up, now’s the time to do it. My advice?

Whether personally or in terms of your occupation, Venus’ journey through vivacious Leo is not only energizing and motivating you, but also making sure the sun shines a light on your unique gifts on a daily basis. You’re just as productive as you are inspired, and you may also receive sweet compliments and encouragement from those you connect with regularly. As for Venus retrograde, however, this is an excellent time to partake in detoxes, cleanses and/or a much-needed decluttering in your personal space. You have the courage to maximize your day in the best way possible, and the more authentic you are in your approach, the better.
