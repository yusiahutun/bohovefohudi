A storytelling bard theatrically excavating ancient and contemporary lyrics of love, loss, lust and revenge, resuscitating them to nerve-shredding life. A critic once described her as a “postmodern cabaret singer”, a term she emphatically approves of. “Jazz is such a maligned genre, anyway. Over the course of my teenage years popular TV shows would make fun of jazz, no one likes it at large – so,” she muses, “I kind of love it.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is the richest Richie family member? Net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Salvant’s command of the stage is so memorable, it’s an account of her performing “If This Isn’t Love” at New York’s 88-year-old Village Vanguard – a song written in 1946 and made famous by 50s icon Sarah Vaughan – that opens Playing the Changes, an excellent collection of essays by former NPR critic Nate Chinen arguing the vital, insistent claim that jazz has entered a newly fertile period of relevance and creativity in the 21st century. “Salvant shows she’s neither wrestling with ghosts nor shouldering the weight of obligation,” writes the author. “Rather than evoke the past from a stance of decorum of deference, Salvant is bent on stirring it up with sly intellectual rigour.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Jazz is such a maligned genre, anyway. No one likes it at large – so I kind of love it</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, it’s difficult to square Chinen’s account – or the larger-than-life character I saw on stage at Tennessee’s Big Ears festival at the end of March, six weeks ahead of our interview – with the relatively introverted, mere mortal in front of me on Zoom. (“A super honour,” quips Salvant about her placement in the book. “I didn’t know there was anything to even make note of. I’m just out here doing it, it was wild and great.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/78b99841-dc94-4ce4-8bc8-bcbfee1de017_490dcf6b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doing it, she is – both wild and great. Salvant makes singing a form of collective communication, a communal rite – it’s no coincidence that she comes from nurturing parents who were not afraid to tear things up before starting again. Her French mother lived in Africa, South America and the Caribbean before settling in Miami, Florida, where she founded an immersive language school; her dad, a doctor, left his native Haiti to practise as a doctor. Raised between cultures, Salvant sings equally powerfully and regularly in English and French, as well as employing Spanish and, lately, Haitian Creole and Occitan, a medieval language spoken in the South of France.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Tiffany Chen, Robert De Niro’s girlfriend and mum of his 7th child?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was brought up by travellers, by multilingual people, curious people – people who all taught themselves English when they got to America – foreigners,” she says, with an emphasis that glorifies rather than disparages the term. “Adaptable people, people who have seen and experienced many, many different cultures in their lives, [so I gained] the culture that comes back from those travels, and the appreciation for art, and not just art but folk art, and folk music from all over the world.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She praises her mother’s restless craftiness – a student of ancient handicrafts, French bobbin lace and carpentry alike – and her sister’s “wild, crazy and surrealist” visual art as creative fuel.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">I was brought up by travellers, by multilingual people, curious people – people who all taught themselves English when they got to America – foreigners</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Salvant’s own artistry is not just that of the musician or entertainer but, mirroring her role in the family unit as a first generation child, as an interpreter and translator. “I was shaped with this thing of translating, of understanding how to speak to people who don’t fully understand what you’re saying,” she says. “This hybridity was really enriching. I was brought up in an environment where it was encouraged to be curious, to be autodidactic, to teach oneself things. There was just a lot of creativity bursting everywhere and I was really lucky to be brought up around people who did things with their hands, and did it just for the sake of doing it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/94cd3345-0db0-434e-97e2-b55740d9996e_1638767f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Savant made her own geographical departure, moving at the age of 18 to Aix-en-Provence, France, to study both law (a career backup?), as well as classical and baroque voice at the Conservatoire Darius Milhaud – tidy supporting evidence to the “postmodern cabaret” tag. “I apply a lot of that to how I sing – I do more ornamentation than the improvisation that a jazz singer would do,” she adds. “I don’t scat.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">XO, Kitty’s Hong Kong-raised Sang Heon Lee on his acting debut – interview</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shortly after returning to the States, she won the prestigious annual Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Award in 2010 at the age of 21 – only the fourth vocalist to do so in the honour’s then-23-year history. (The event was renamed the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz Competition in 2019.) Three years later, she came out with major-label debut WomanChild, and her coronation came with subsequent outings For One to Love (2015) and the sprawling live set Dreams and Daggers (2017) – both Grammy winners for best jazz vocal album.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While a dozen or so original songs are littered across these career-making collections, Salvant’s reputation was built, live and on record, in the time-old tradition of reinterpreting existing material – treading through the standards songbook that has defined so much of post-war jazz, most often backed by the classic configuration of drums, bass and piano. “I’ve never sung super-famous standards – I would pick songs based on how much I loved them, and preferably how few people recorded them,” she protests. “There’s no ‘Fly Me to the Moon’, I’m not doing ‘My Funny Valentine’.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">I’ve never sung super-famous standards … There’s no ‘Fly Me to the Moon’, I’m not doing ‘My Funny Valentine’</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, she compares her curatorial role to that of a DJ – particularly a “Belgium popcorn” DJ of the 80s. “The currency was, how deep is the deep cut of doo-wop tunes you’re DJing?” she says. “I love that kind of thing – here’s something that’s out of print, that no one’s heard of, let’s discover it together. It’s like going into the library and looking in the back and rummaging through the dusty books and finding something really beautiful – that’s something that’s such a joy to me that I never want to stop doing.”</p>Her next release shaved this approach down to its naked core: Salvant’s voice was paired with nothing but Sullivan Fortner’s piano for the stretch of the 17-song, 70-minute set of The Window (2018). It’s this empathetic duet that is currently on tour, and will be stopping in Hong Kong for a string of dates at <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the exclusive Carlyle & Co. club</span></a> (June 21-24), before a larger public show at Tsuen Wan Town Hall on June 25. Together the pair have a repertoire that Salvant claims reaches into three figures, and “essentially the set list doesn’t exist”.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Blackpink’s Jennie and BTS’ V’s ‘romance’ heats up</span></p></a></h3>Doing the same thing every night was never her bag, although “maybe if it was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a Beyoncé-level cheque</span></a>, I’d make an effort”. Yet this laid-back duo might feel like something of a throwback – this “rain-check tour” was originally planned for 2020 and predates the career left-turn of Ghost Song (2022), her debut for the Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records that ushered in a new creative and commercial platform.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/e1f8ae41-b0bf-42ad-ad88-096c94242ca5_490dcf6b.jpg>Perhaps unsurprisingly, most attention first focused on the opener, a haunting cover of Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights” that chimed with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a Stranger Things-literate Gen Z audience</span></a> (a track she only performs live “on special occasions”, in a medley with Bush’s “Breathing”). But for the first time, more than half of the album is made up of Salvant’s own songs. And what diverse songs they are: a curious mixtape wiggling between smouldering R&B and swampy blues to frenetic throwback chanson, electro drones and hillbilly twang. The record’s breadth is demonstrated in the four other non-original tracks: a Sting cover, a 19th century English folk song, and tunes from The Wizard of Oz and Bertolt Brecht’s and Kurt Weill’s Threepenny Opera. Weirdest of all, self-penned “Lost My Mind” offers a template for Salvant’s new Auto-Tune experiments, her shrill, ominous vocals hovering over a synthy organ drone like a horror movie from hell.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Should I do a Kate Bush song, is that crazy? – now that feels so run of the mill to me</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The album took a long time to finish, but was recorded in less than 10 days over a six-month period in 2020. (“Most of that half year was spent at home watching TV and Netflix,” says Salvant.) But the pandemic-era vinyl shortage delayed the release until March 2022. “Now it feels rather old,” she adds, “and some of the things I was hesitating to do and was scared to do – should I do a Kate Bush song, is that crazy? – now that feels so run of the mill to me.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Marvel star Chris Pratt makes and spends his US$80 million fortune</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pandemic was both a blessing and curse for Salvant. Despite obvious frustrations, after a decade of relentless touring, it presented the opportunity for creative renewal. “It was weird, but I didn’t mind it so much because I got to make things and be creative in ways that I hadn’t really experienced before – everything, art, music, whatever, just dilly-dallying creatively with various things, and not having an audience to think about,” she muses. “I have a tendency to want to please people a lot, and suddenly the people were gone, so it was just me pleasing myself, and making things for fun and out of playfulness, out of exploration and experimentation … while it felt like there was an apocalypse going on outside.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/35502544-ddd7-43a2-9fe1-908ea929b791_b16f5f7a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Self-identifying as a “people pleaser” might generally carry a cloud of neurosis and negativity, but for a performer, sending away a happy audience is a necessary part of the job description. Professional artists are required to balance the raw, uncompromising instincts that produce genuinely inventive, personal work, and the demands of the audience that sustains their livelihood. “That [instinct] is baked into my personality,” admits Salvant. “When I perform live and people are coming to hear me, I want everyone to have a good time and I don’t want anyone to be bored, and I think that’s positive – but also those [instincts] can be traps when you’re trying to be creative. It sometimes feels like those two desires can’t coexist, or there’s a balance to be found between the two.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">When I perform live and people are coming to hear me, I want everyone to have a good time and I don’t want anyone to be bored</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arguably, that balance found a happy equilibrium with this year’s Mélusine, a concept album of sorts gathering many of the French chanson and art songs that have formed part of her live repertoire for years. What unites them, though, is a guiding narrative arc Salvant has constructed, or rather repurposed, from the French folkloric legend of a woman who turns into a half-snake on Saturdays, remembered in a story captured by Jean d’Arras in 1393, documenting the titular character’s marriage and eventually unmasking. Yet secretly sown into this ancient music was the most modern sonics of her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/2322638b-5c70-4c9c-acfb-349bb876ec3b_490dcf6b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before acquiring Logic, Salvant made her own pandemic home experiments with the super-primitive, entry-level (and free) GarageBand software. A handful of these “stupid GarageBand loopy things” ended up being smuggled into the finished album, short beat-driven tracks (“Aida”, “Wedo”, the spoken-word “Donna N’Almucs”) that somewhat seamlessly segue between the rest of Mélusine’s rootsy organic, live-band instrumentation. And then we’re back on the cable. “There’s always little clues in what I do for the next thing,” she adds. “In this last album there’s a few tracks that are my little GarageBand stupidities, where I was like wait, let’s use this, this could actually work – stop saying that things are silly, sometimes silly is good.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 Hong Kong mother-daughter power duos, from Faye Wong to Mimi Kung</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A readily quoted reference point for these moments is Fiona Apple’s DIY home-recording experiments on widely feted 2020 masterpiece Fetch the Bolt Cutters. Salvant is quicker to praise its predecessor, The Idler Wheel, first encountered a decade earlier. “When I saw what she did with that album, I said, “Wow, you can do that?’ Firstly, the writing is so direct – none of that meandering vibe that you can have in some singer-songwriter stuff – it just punches you right in the face,” she remembers. “But also the production is insane – drums, percussion – it felt like a new level for her, like she was exploding into something different.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/1aafb88f-5082-4e63-808b-c63a6878d33b_1334193f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One imagines Salvant is capable of the same explosive, iconoclastic feats, although something might be holding her back. “I kinda like the idea of going in and out and going deep into the tradition and maybe doing something super, super traditional and classic and inside – and also doing the most insane. It’s funny because there’s no laws, but somehow there are so many laws – and sometimes in fact there are, you have contracts that don’t allow you to do that,” she shares. You do?
