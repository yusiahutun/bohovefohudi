<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The Duchess of Sussex was the talk of the town over the weekend. Not exactly Tinsel Town like we’re used to with her Hollywood links, but instead, Lady Justice. There were rumors Meghan Markle is prepared to jump into politics as her next gig, but it seems that’s out of the window already..</strong>.<strong> Or is it?</strong></p><p>The rumor mill was on overdrive over the past few days. It came following the death of Dianne Feinstein and her vacant seat as California Senator. The Mail on Sunday wrote within “minutes” of the 90-year-old passing away, “phones were lit up” speculating <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> may make her mark in politics. A source claimed at the time not many candidates “fit the bill”, and the <a href=#>royal</a>‘s name was being spoken by all the right people. We now know, with the latest update, a replacement has been found – and it’s not the Duchess. Despite the close call, one royal expert has dived into what would turn out to be ‘repercussions’ for Harry if Meghan Markle did indeed swap her Suits for politics in Capitol Hill.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-is-in-a-prime-position-for-politics>‘Meghan Markle is in a prime position for politics’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-159514888-701x1024.jpg><p>Daniela Elser, royal commentator, has given <a href=# rel=nofollow>her two cents</a> at what could have been. Although Meghan isn’t named as the new Senator, there’s no telling what could happen in the future.</p><p>She claims at NewsAU: “The advent of the Senator from Suits would put the Sussex name back on the map in terms of having actual importance, sway and weight in a way it hasn’t for years.</p><p>“It would also prevent their total slide into the irrelevance of being little more, Californian celebrities.”</p><p>Elser also warned it could cause ripples over the Atlantic. She added: “If, and this is an Everest-sized ‘if’, Meghan were to enter the fray, there would surely be some sort of Buckingham Palace push back and quick sticks maneuvering in terms of their Sussex title.</p><p>“Would the duchess be willing to sacrifice being a duchess for the sake of the occasional photo op with Nancy Pelosi or a guaranteed invitation to the Buttigiegs’ Cinco de Mayo potluck?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-repercussions-for-harry>‘Repercussions for Harry’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1393010794-1024x683.jpg><p>Elser also warned: “There could also be possible repercussions for Harry’s role as a Counsellor of State back in the UK.”</p><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s role is vital. In the event that the monarch can’t undertake their official duties as Sovereign on a temporary basis, or takes ill, two or more Counsellors of State are appointed. They will act in His Majesty’s place when and where needed.</p><p>Although a traditional role, if that were to happen, it’s likely <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Catherine will step in where needed. This was common when <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II </a>reigned. As Charles and the now <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>, and the Prince and Princess of Wales, stepped in more than once.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-not-the-first-time>It’s not the first time</h2><p>Now, it’s not new information of Meghan Markle reportedly eyeing up a career in politics after <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. A source told Vanity Fair as far back as 2020 she wanted to keep that “option open”.</p><p>They <a href=# rel=nofollow>claimed</a>: “One of the reasons [Meghan] was so keen not to give up her American citizenship was, so she had the option to go into politics”.</p><p>The Times then reported a Democratic strategist said the 42-year-old was “definitely putting her toe in the water”. She could follow the same path other celebrity politicians have taken, like <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, who became the Californian Governor.</p><p>It’s also not the only time she has linked to senators. In November 2021, news circulated Meghan was cold-calling Republican Senators to advocate for paid family leave. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine explained the former <a href=#>TV</a> star called her private line out of the blue. She also introduced herself with her title – The Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>“Much to my surprise, she called me on my private line, and she introduced herself as the Duchess of Sussex, which is kind of ironic,” Senator Collins told Politico.</p><p>“I was happy to talk with her. But I’m more interested in what the people of Maine are telling me about it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-it-could-spark-a-problem-with-the-royals>Why it could spark a problem with the royals</h2><p>British royals are traditionally expected to remain political neutral. They’re not allowed to vote in elections and can’t be seen as biased.</p><p>In Britain, whichever party wins the most votes, is then asked officially to ‘form’ a government from the monarch. This would now be <a href=#>King Charles</a>. Therefore, if anyone in The Firm spoke out in favor of a particular party, it would cause a problem if another party won.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped down as senior royals in 2020. They moved to Canada before finding their paradise in their <a href=#>Montecito mansion in California</a>.</p><p>After their move, they have shown interest in politics, even after <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s comments on Donald Trump</a> in 2017.</p><p>Ahead of cold-calling Senator Capito, the mom-of-two penned a letter to Congress championing for paid family leave in the US. She also interviewed Michelle Obama for her guest-edited issue of British Vogue in 2019.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2V%2FcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kqaeZqLKledOoZJudXZeupLeMqKVmrJiaeq6tz2afmqtdqLKztc6uqmaqlaWys6%2FUrKqip56oeqe70Wafmqqirnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-poised-to-be-back-on-the-map-has-serious-repercussions-for-harry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sveta-bilyalova.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sveta-bilyalova.html>Sveta Bilyalova Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jake-austin-walker-is-a-born-hunter-on-national-treasure-edge-of-history-2.html>Jake Austin Walker is a Born Hunter on National Treasure: Edge of History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jake-austin-walker-is-a-born-hunter-on-national-treasure-edge-of-history-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
