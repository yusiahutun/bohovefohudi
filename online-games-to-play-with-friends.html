<time>29 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>While we currently live in a world filled with video <a href=# id=auto-tag_games data-tag=games>games</a> and ways to connect virtually, it can feel like there aren’t that many <a href=# rel=noopener>online games to play with friends</a> when you’re not actually with them in real life. Game nights can bring out our most competitive side and allow for seriously fun evenings, but what happens when you’re in separate houses, the last game was a tie and you need to clench a victory? (Everybody likes to win, OK?) Even figuring out how to play old-school board or card games over <a href=# id=auto-tag_video-chat data-tag=video-chat>video chat</a> can be a difficult situation. Thanks to a little virtual digging, though, we discovered 21 different games you can play both online and with your friends. Forget the computer-generated opponent — Now you can easily have a <a href=# rel=noopener>virtual game night</a> with your BFFs.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mean-girls.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/amazon-prime-day-alternative-sales.jpg><p>Seriously, there are so many ways to play online games with your friends that are interactive, fun and — in some cases — totally free. Gather your pals for a night of card games similar to Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity. Or, stick with classic games like UNO! or Checkers. There’s no wrong way to play these <a href=# rel=noopener>virtual group games</a>, so go ahead and pick your favorite. The only thing that truly makes online games better is getting to share them with your loved ones. Sure, things are starting to slowly open back up, but many of us are still stuck at home, so why not continue game night traditions or late-night friend hangouts virtually?</p><p><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Moriarty’s Game: A Killer in the Hive</h2><p>HiddenCity’s recently launched <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Moriarty’s Game: A Killer in the Hive</a> allows you to immerse yourself in a modern adaptation of the iconic Sherlock Holmes stories in the comfort of your own home. The immersive 90-minute game transforms players into private investigators, planning undercover operations, luring in potential suspects, and hacking security systems with the guidance of Private Investigator Kayla Watson. Best of all, players are able to play with friends in teams of one to five players, whether in the same house or remotely via video call.</p><h2>2. Quiplash On Jackbox Games</h2><p>Quiplash is a great online option that gets everyone in a group involved, and can easily be played on a PC, Mac or Linux computer. Everyone tries to write the funniest answer to a question, each person then votes and a winner of the round is declared. You can play Quiplash easily with members of your household or friends who are far away.</p><h2>3. Sims 4 Multiplayer</h2><p>Because technology is ridiculously innovative, you can now play&nbsp;Sims 4&nbsp;with other players online. You have to download the&nbsp;Sims 4 multiplayer mod, and then you’re good to meet up with your BFFs virtually and hang out in the Sims world.</p><h2>4. Skribbl</h2><p>Skribbl is kind of like a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">combination of Pictionary and trivia.</a> Once you create a private room on the site for your friends, you choose a word from the list provided and attempt to draw it—in 80 seconds. Everyone else has to guess what you’re drawing. If you’re an artist, this is your time to shine, baby.</p><h2>5. GamePigeon</h2><p>The GamePigeon app lets you play different games online with your phone—so you don’t need a gaming device or even a computer. Available right now are 8-Ball (pool), Poker, Sea Battle (which is basically Battleship) and several more. These games are only two-player, though, so best if you just want to play with one other person!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mario-figure-game-unsplash.jpg><h2>6. Mario Kart Tour</h2><p>The Mario Kart Tour app allows you to race your friends at high speeds. It’s basically like playing video games IRL, except this time, you’re all on your phones.</p><h2>7. GameFly</h2><p>If you have a gaming console at home, you’re in luck. GameFly rush delivers everything from classic games from Zelda to Star Wars to recent releases like Disaster Report 4 and Resident Evil 3 to your door. With a free trial for every game, you can test-drive games and only pay for what you want to keep. Depending on your console, newer games allow you to play directly against friends online. Old school game fans can just <a href=# id=auto-tag_zoom data-tag=zoom>Zoom</a> their friends when they cue up <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Party</a>.</p><h2>8. Checkers</h2><p>If you’re into a one-on-one virtual game, you can play Checkers online while catching up with a friend or family member. This is especially nice for interacting virtually with someone who might not be as up-to-date on technology.</p><h2>9. Crazy Eights</h2><p>Re-live your childhood with the classic card game Crazy Eights. Just send your room link to your friends or family members, and you’re ready to play.</p><h2>10. Chips & Guac on Houseparty</h2><p>If you use <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Houseparty</a> to video chat with your friends, you’re going to want to try out their game Chips & Guac. It’s similar to Apples to Apples, so if you love games where you choose the best card to match another one, you’ll love this game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TX8WTjiuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><h2>11. UNO!</h2><p>UNO! has always been an <a data-pmc-sp-product=985845e336695254efc406b169501113 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"iconic card game","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Mattel Games UNO Card Game for Family Night, Travel Game & Gift for Kids in a Collectible Storage Tin for 2-10 Players (Amazon Exclusive)","price":"11.14","id":"B07P6MZPK3","category":"Dedicated Deck Card Games"},"id":1103714,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>iconic card game</a> , and now you can play it virtually with your loved ones. It works just like it would IRL, only you play with virtual cards. Simple. As. That.</p><h2>12. Communal Puzzles</h2><p>Because apparently anything is possible, you can do<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> jigsaw puzzles</a> with your friends&nbsp;online. This might be the most relaxing virtual game in existence.</p><h2>13. Clue</h2><p>Now you can play your favorite <a href=#>board game from childhood</a> virtually with all your friends. The app does cost $3.99, but that’s a small price to pay for endless hours of mystery fun, right?!</p><h2>14. Drawful 2 On Jackbox Games</h2><p>For a limited time Jackbox Games is offering their game Drawful 2 for&nbsp;free, so you can play with your friends while <a href=# id=auto-tag_social-distancing data-tag=social-distancing>social distancing</a>. The game basically prompts you to draw different (often ridiculous) things on your tablet or smartphone. You can even <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">play Jackbox Games remotely on Zoom</a>, if that’s your preferred method of video chatting.</p><h2>15. Oregon Trail</h2><p>OK, so&nbsp;Oregon Trail might be just a one-player game, but nothing is stopping you from playing while on the phone or video chatting with your friends! Just start at the same time and narrate your journey to one another. You can <a href=# rel=noopener>play online for free</a> and try to avoid dysentery at all costs.</p><h2>16. Psych</h2><p>With the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">game app Psych</a> you can get on your phone and play with your friends while also video chatting. You and your BFFs make up fake answers to trivia questions, and then let one player try and guess which answer is actually true. If you want to get personal, too, there’s an option that allows you to make up answers to questions about your friends—so you can see who really knows you.</p><h2>17. Scattergories</h2><p>If you’ve ever played the game Categories, this online version works the same way. All you have to do is pick a category (like books, types of sodas, fruits—You get the picture.) and have everyone name something in that category. The first person who can’t think of anything is out. If you’d rather not come up with your categories, though, you can rely on this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Scattergories generator</a> to help out. (It also makes for a really fun drinking game!)</p><h2>18. Online Bingo</h2><p>You might think Bingo is just for retirement homes, but it’s low-key&nbsp;very fun.&nbsp;And now, thanks to this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">online bingo card generator</a>, you can play with your friends while you talk on Zoom. It’s completely free, and you can have up to 30 (!!!) players. If you have a bigger group, though, there’s the option to pay for an extra 70 cards. Huge friend groups, rejoice!</p><h2>19. Stay The F*ck Inside</h2><p>Stay the Fuck Inside is a virtual drinking game actually created for social distancing. For $4.99, you get <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">150 different cards</a> with games like “dare or drink” and “categories” that you and your friends can play virtually. The game allows as many players as you want, so if your Zoom is getting full, this might be the option for you.</p><h2>20. QuizUp</h2><p>Available for both iOS and Android, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">QuizUp</a> isn’t your average trivia game. There are topics ranging from Disney trivia and The Simpsons trivia—and even&nbsp;Game of Thrones trivia. (!!!) Text your pals and tell them to meet you on the app, and let the games begin. You also easily turn this one into a virtual drinking game.
