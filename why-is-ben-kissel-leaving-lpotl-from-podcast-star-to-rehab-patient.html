From Podcast Star to Rehab Patient 1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Last Podcast on the Left, or LPOTL for short, stands as a beloved comedy, true crime, and horror podcast, boasting a trio of hosts in the form of Ben Kissel, Marcus Parks, and Henry Zebrowski.</p><p>This show delves into a diverse array of intriguing subjects, including serial killers, cults, the supernatural, and conspiracy theories. LPOTL first took the podcasting stage in 2011 and has clinched numerous accolades, including the prestigious Webby Award for Best Comedy Podcast in 2019.</p><p>However, as the calendar flipped to September 2023, loyal listeners began to notice Ben Kissel’s conspicuous absence from recent episodes. His co-hosts stepped forward to reveal that he had taken a hiatus from the show to prioritize his mental and physical well-being.</p><p>Furthermore, they earnestly implored their fanbase to cease the harassment directed at Ben’s ex-girlfriend, who had made allegations of abuse against him via social media. This article aims to shed light on the circumstances surrounding Ben Kissel’s departure from LPOTL and the subsequent reactions rippling through the podcast community.</p><h3><strong>Allegations of Abuse</strong></h3><p>A pivotal factor that might have contributed to Ben Kissel’s exit from LPOTL revolves around allegations of abuse that surfaced online in August 2023. A TikTok user by the name of Taylor, under the handle @booboobirdie, shared a video explicitly naming Ben Kissel as her abuser while appealing to LPOTL for intervention.</p><p>Taylor’s distressing account depicted Ben as an alcoholic who subjected her to mistreatment during their relationship, which included verbal abuse, physical restraint, and threats. She also asserted that he had engaged in infidelity with multiple women, including a co-worker.</p><p>In September 2023, Taylor posted a follow-up video expressing her frustration at not receiving any response from LPOTL and sharing concerns about her safety. She disclosed that Ben had accessed her personal information and made attempts to contact her through various platforms. Additionally, Taylor accused him of misrepresenting his age, claiming he was 44 years old instead of the 39 years he professed.</p><p>These videos ignited a maelstrom of controversy and debate within the LPOTL fanbase. While some extended empathy and solidarity to Taylor, others scrutinized her credibility and motivations. Criticism also emerged regarding LPOTL’s handling of the situation, with fans questioning the podcast’s silence on social media and the delayed response.</p><h3><strong>Treatment for Mental and Physical Health</strong></h3><p>Another conceivable reason behind Ben Kissel’s departure from LPOTL lies in his personal mental and physical health challenges. On September 14, 2023, Marcus Parks and Henry Zebrowski conveyed in an episode of LPOTL (Side Stories: Bullet in the Backseat) that Ben had embarked on a path toward treatment and would eventually return.</p><p>They disclosed their long-standing concerns for his mental and physical well-being, emphasizing the importance of seeking professional assistance. The hosts also assured listeners that a lineup of friends and family would temporarily step in to fill Ben’s role during his absence.</p><p>Although Ben has remained publicly silent following this announcement, it is plausible that he is grappling with alcohol dependency, a topic hinted at in Taylor’s allegations and his previous admissions on LPOTL. Alcohol misuse carries grave implications for one’s overall health, encompassing damage to the liver, heart, brain, mood, sleep patterns, relationships, and more. It can also heighten the risk of aggression, depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>In summation, Ben Kissel has opted to step away from LPOTL indefinitely, directing his attention toward the restoration of his mental and physical well-being. Simultaneously, he grapples with allegations of abuse from his ex-girlfriend, who has taken to TikTok to voice her grievances, accusing him of alcoholism and mistreatment during their relationship.</p><p>These circumstances have likely played a role in his decision to take a hiatus from the show while seeking treatment. Marcus Parks and Henry Zebrowski have voiced their support for their colleague and requested that fans respect his privacy while discontinuing harassment of his ex-girlfriend. The podcast will continue to provide content, with guest hosts temporarily filling the void until Ben’s eventual return.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63LpaqhnV6YvK571qGwZqGjYq%2BmuoykoKyrlaF6rbHAr6Cnn12hvbDAy2adq6edYr2wsMKaqq1lo6mus3nTqGSrnZiWr268wK2gnqakZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-ben-kissel-leaving-lpotl-from-podcast-star-to-rehab-patient.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./6627c01a46163faa8e8b45b4-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./6627c01a46163faa8e8b45b4-html.html>Amrica vs Pachuca canal y hora: dnde ver hoy, transmisin y pronstico Semifinal Concachampion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./francois-graff.html>Who is Francois Graff dating?
