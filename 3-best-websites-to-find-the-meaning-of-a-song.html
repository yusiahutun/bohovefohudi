You probably like a lot of music, but the best songs are usually ones with lyrics that have a deeper meaning when you really consider them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next time you want to get lyric interpretations for a song, you can turn to the internet. Here are the best sites for looking up the meanings of songs, whether official or through someone else's perspective.</p><h2 id=songmeanings>1. <a href=#>SongMeanings</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SongMeanings-Site-Search.png><p>Arguably the best song meanings website, SongMeanings, has been around for decades. Look up any song, and you'll find lyrics and (hopefully) comments discussing them. In 2011, the site partnered with LyricFind in order to officially license lyrics for many songs.</p><p>On the main page, you'll see top artists, trending songs, and recent comments. If you aren't interested in any of those, simply search with the bar at the top. This will show songs, albums, and artists that match your query. If you browse an artist page, you can easily see how many comments each of their songs have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can read comments without logging in, but you'll need to make an account to contribute to the site. The site allows you to respond to other people's comments, as well as add your own. If you register, you can also edit lyrics if you find a mistake.</p><p>At the time of writing, the site contained over a million lyrics and some 1.7 million comments, so you're bound to find a discussion on a song you like. It's a great first stop when you want to see what other people think of a song.</p><h2 id=songfacts>2. <a href=#>Songfacts</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Songfacts-Website.png><p>This one provides something a little different than lyric interpretation websites. Instead of people offering their thoughts on what a song means, it collects interesting bits of info on specific music tracks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The homepage has highlighted artists and songs, as well as interesting categories (such as "songs with beverages in the title"). Search for a song or artist using the bar at the topâ€”just note that <strong>Songs</strong> is the default, so you'll need to switch to the <strong>Artists</strong> tab manually if you search for one.</p><p>Once you select a song, you'll see various "Songfacts" about it. Not all of these have citations, though some of them do link to relevant interviews or videos. While there's no way to confirm these facts are 100 percent correct, the site doesn't let visitors add them. Thus, you can be reasonably sure the information is accurate.</p><p>Some bands also have "Artistfacts," which are similar factoids that concern the band as a whole. Take a look and maybe you'll learn something new about your favorite bands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=genius>3. <a href=#>Genius</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Genius-Lyrics-Website.png><p>Genius has provided users with the ability to look up the meaning of songs since 2009. While it was originally founded as Rap Genius with a focus on hip-hop music, it's since branched out to cover every genre.</p><p>Like the other sites, you can search for a song or artist using the top bar. Take a look at top tracks for an artist if you like, then click a song. You'll see its lyrics, along with information about the track's recording.</p><p>The rest of what you see depends on the song. Some include artist-sourced information about the track or even the whole album. Otherwise, Genius's key feature is that you can annotate certain lyrics and add your thoughts on them. You'll see a gray highlight around lyrics someone has annotated. Click them to take a look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can view these lyric interpretations without an account, but you'll need to sign up to take full advantage of the site. This allows you to post your own annotations, suggest improvements to what others have added, and upvote/downvote annotations. You can also leave a general comment if you don't have any specific lines to annotate.</p><h2 id=lyric-interpretations>4. <a href=#>Lyric Interpretations</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lyric-Interpretations-Website.png><p>This site isn't as polished as the above, but it's still worth stopping by if your search for a song meaning hasn't been satisfied yet. Search for a song or select one from the homepage, and you'll see various interpretations posted by other users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone who visits the site can rate these interpretations from one to five stars. The best ones rise to the top, but of course this doesn't mean they're the official meaning.</p><p>If you're looking to discover more music with interesting lyrics, you'll see categories on the site's sidebar that you can explore. These include "songs that tell a story" and "songs about not being good enough," among others.</p><h2 id=lyricsmode>5. <a href=#>LyricsMode</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LyricsMode-Website.png><p>This site isn't popular as the above, so you might struggle to find lyrics on it. But it's still worth mentioning in a collection of song meaning websites.</p><p>Like the others, you'll see feeds of hot tracks and artists on the homepage. Search for something you'd like to dig into using the top bar, and you can read the track's lyrics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the lyric page, you can either highlight a specific bit of the lyrics and explain them, or leave a comment to explain the overall meaning. You can also highlight some lyrics and click <strong>Request</strong> to ask the community what they think that part means.</p><h2 id=wikipedia>6. <a href=#>Wikipedia</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Wikipedia-Song-Lyric-Meanings-Paramore.png><p>Still can't find information about the lyrics of your favorite song? Try turning to Wikipedia if nothing else has given you the answers you seek. While it's not a proper lyrics meaning website, you'll often find a bit of backstory on albums and songs when you look them up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simply search for the name of the song you want to look up. For singles and other popular songs, Wikipedia typically includes a dedicated page with information about the song's performance, reception, and other information. You'll sometimes find background or meaning info in a dedicated section or the intro.</p><p>If you can't find any info on the particular track, try looking at the album's entry. There might be more detailed info on certain tracks or the album's overall themes there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Wikipedia Tools and Alternatives for a Better Online Free Encyclopedia</a></span></p><h2 id=figure-out-the-meaning-of-a-song-easily>Figure Out the Meaning of a Song Easily</h2><p>Next time you want to find the meaning of a song, you'll know where to look. Most of these websites are built by people like you who want to dig deeper into their favorite music.</p><p>Thus, after you discover the meaning of some lyrics, why not pay it forward and comment on a few songs yourself? You never know who will appreciate it in the future.</p><p>Don't forget that there are lots of useful online tools that help you identify music if you don't know the name of the song, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9faHqjsdKtZLCdkqi2tbHSZquoZZaeu6V506GcZqWVlruqusZmpp9lkWLAsLrGaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f3-best-websites-to-find-the-meaning-of-a-song.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./40-facts-about-billy-gardell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./40-facts-about-billy-gardell.html>40 Facts About Billy Gardell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-taylor-to-perform-a-brief-las-vegas-residency-in-june.html>James Taylor To Perform A Brief Las Vegas Residency In June</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-taylor-to-perform-a-brief-las-vegas-residency-in-june.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
