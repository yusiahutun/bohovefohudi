It showed <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> sitting down on a couch with her great grandchildren in the photo. It was released by Kensington Palace to celebrate her life to mark the special day, where she would have been 97.

However, within hours, editors had picked it apart and noticed several instances where it appeared the picture was edited.</p><p>Following speculation, Catherine posted an apology the following day admitting she dabbled in Photoshop as an amateur photographer.</p><p>She said: ‚ÄúLike many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother‚Äôs Day.
