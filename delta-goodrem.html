And it was this sentiment exactly that got the Neighbours actress-turned-multi-million-selling music artist started on her career, aged 12. With the hope of singing at a football match for her favourite team the Sydney Swans, she sent them a five-track demo. Blown away by her talent, they sent it to one of their biggest supporters, Australian artist manager Glen Wheatley. He snapped her up immediately, developing her career up to the point she was signed to Sony and, aged 15, given a part on Australia's best-loved soap.&nbsp;</p><h2>Delta Goodrem's early life and career</h2><p id=eIlA53t5W5w data-wc=120>Born in Sydney on November 9, 1984, Delta showed a strong interest in music and performing from a very young age. She began playing the piano and taking singing, dancing and acting lessons aged seven. "I have been singing for as long as I could talk," she admits. As a young child, she appeared in TV commercials and had minor roles in several Australian series, but it was her 2002 portrayal of shy schoolgirl and aspiring singer Nina Tucker in that brought her widespread fame and helped launch her music career. Her piano ballad, Born To Try premiered on the show and went on to become her first Australian number one, climbing to number three in the UK charts.</p><p id=eMKsLIR6TvH data-wc=74>For the next year she was busier than ever, going into the studio after a day on the Neighbours set, often working till 4 am to record her debut album Innocent Eyes. Her hard work paid off. The disc went in at the top of the Australian charts and stayed there for a record-breaking 25 weeks. It reached number two in the UK, went platinum 14 times and sold more than 2.5 million copies.</p><p id=eeBv77Cz0pl data-wc=135>Despite the differences in their styles, comparisons between Delta and Kylie followed after Delta's four consecutive number ones overtook the pop princess' record of three from her debut album Kylie. In 2003, with her career at full throttle Delta then aged 18 was diagnosed with cancer. She dropped out of Neighbours to concentrate on treatment, but never took her mind off her music. After announcing she had gone into remission in 2004, and with her schedule free as she made her recovery, she set about recording a second album, Mistaken Identity. At the end of 2004 she found love when she began dating former Westlife singer Brian McFadden whose marriage to Atomic Kitten Kerry Katona had come to an end. The pair were engaged and together a number of years but broke up in 2011.</p><p id=eXUQxfIBRY7 data-wc=23>After, Delta would go on to date Nick Jonas but the romance didn't last. In 2017, she began dating fellow musician Matthew Copley.</p><h2>Delta Goodrem's later career</h2><p id=eeXjgWcMHf1 data-wc=70>In 2007, Delta would release her third studio album which then lead to a world tour. But in 2011, TV came knocking and she joined the panel of the Australian version of alongside Keith Urban, Joel Madden and Seal. A few years later, she also made a return to to reprise her role as Nina Tucker and began regular TV acting in shows such as House Husbands. &nbsp;</p><p id=e-YovaaD8jK data-wc=25>Her next releases were Child of the Universe, Wings of the Wild, Only Santa Knows and Bridge Over Troubled Dreams, which was released in 2021.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xaWdksaa405pkoKefmb%2BmuY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdelta-goodrem.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marybeth-byrd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marybeth-byrd.html>Marybeth Byrd Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./corey-kluber.html>Corey Kluber</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./corey-kluber.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
