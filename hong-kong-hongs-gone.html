<time>10 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company's dealings with the region included smuggling opium into China. After one of its opium shipments was seized by the Chinese authorities, it persuaded the British government to start the first opium war in 1839. The objective was to force China to pay compensation, cede Hong Kong to Britain, open more ports to trade and legitimise trade in the narcotic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The huge profits gained from opium dealing enabled the group to expand into many other businesses, which formed the foundation of the group we know today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, the hongs dominated the city's commercial landscape up until the 1970s, when the power of these institutions entered an era of prolonged decline.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jardine's traditional role as a middleman was increasingly being undercut as manufacturers started to sell directly to their customers. As a result, Jardine's growth stagnated and it was hit by losses in new ventures when it tried to diversify.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hutchison Whampoa got into trouble after it over-extended itself with numerous acquisitions. It had to be rescued by HSBC, which ended up with about 22 per cent equity stake in the company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wheelock, which was only marginally profitable under the Marden family, was unable to pay for the delivery of some vessels it had ordered when the recession hit in the mid-80s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ironically, HSBC, which was involved in the rise of many of the hongs, also often delivered their death blows, if only by orchestrating their takeovers by non-British, local entrepreneurs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After listing Hutchison Whampoa in 1978, HSBC sold its 22 per cent stake in the company to Li Ka-shing for HK$639 million (which was reportedly at half the fair value) without opening up the sale to competing bids. In addition, HSBC effectively financed Li for the acquisition by giving him deferred payment terms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The deal catapulted Li up the ladder to become one of the leading tycoons in Hong Kong. He later directed much banking business to HSBC to show his gratitude.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HSBC was also instrumental in the rise of Pao Yue-kong. The bank financed the equity required for the construction of his ships, which were financed with Japanese government loans and then leased long term (backed by guarantees issued by Japanese banks) to Japanese trading companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The arrangement made Pao the world's largest ship owner in 1979. Pao astutely cut his fleet during the shipping crisis in the late '70s and used the cash to build a stake in Wharf. With the financing and advice provided by HSBC, he took control of Wharf from Jardines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pao also bought more than a 30 per cent in Wheelock and was engaged in a bidding war with Khoo Teck Puat (a Singaporean banker) who had bought a 14 per cent stake from the Marden family, which he subsequently increased to about 30 per cent. Pao outbid Khoo, who then sold his entire stake to Pao to make an enormous profit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are no permanent enemies in business. In 1986, Pao and Khoo co-operated with Robert Holmes a Court (an Australian corporate raider) to take a significant stake in Standard Chartered Bank, which was devastated by the recession in the mid-80s. The trio's investment helped the bank fend off a hostile take-over from Lloyds Bank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The loss of Wharf, and the fear of losing more assets and being taken over, caused the Jardines group to focus on putting together a costly cross-shareholding structure between Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic. The project occupied Jardines for the better part of the '80s. As a result, it missed out on the opportunity to pick up attractive real estate at bargain prices during the downturn. That formed the basis of the fortunes of many Hong Kong tycoons today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other important factors in the decline of the hongs were the rise of the mainland and the return of Hong Kong to it. Many businesses and people in Hong Kong were deeply concerned about the post-1997 arrangements in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swire Pacific and Jardine Matheson moved their registered offices to Bermuda. Jardines went a step further by shifting its primary stock exchange listings from Hong Kong to London in 1991, and its Asian stock listings from Hong Kong to Singapore in 1994. As a result, Jardines was not able to operate on the mainland in a meaningful way until 1996, after its chairman, Alasdair Morrison, apologised to Beijing. Even after that, Jardines did not make it big on the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swire, on the other hand, was used by the mainland to show its determination to maintain the prosperity of Hong Kong after the handover and stem the flight of businesses from the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1987, Citic took a 12.5 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific after it was listed in 1986. Citic took the position to demonstrate the mainland's commitment to Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike Jardines, Swire had been able to increase its presence in the mainland through the '80s and '90s in partnership with Citic and other mainland partners. For example, it set up beverage and paint production plants and Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company, and acquired a 25 per cent interest in Shekou Container Terminals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But even Swire's excellent connections and consummate deal-making skills on the mainland, could not prevent mainland interests from encroaching on its businesses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the handover approached, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) reportedly threatened to set up a rival airline in Hong Kong to compete with Cathay Pacific on its profitable international routes. To head off this threat, Cathay Pacific sold new shares to Citic to increase its stake to 25 per cent, paring Swire's stake to below the controlling 50 per cent level. CNAC also acquired around 36 per cent of Dragonair to become its largest shareholder, cutting Cathay Pacific's and Swire's combined stake from 43 per cent to 25.5 per cent. In return, CNAC agreed to limit itself to developing Dragonair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In contrast, Hong Kong companies faced no such impediments. They have expanded rapidly in recent decades, growth that has largely passed the hongs by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdpbn55fpNon6iml2K4sLrGZp%2Boppeoeqi7zZ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhong-kong-hongs-gone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-criticised-wearing-blazer-plunging-neckline-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-criticised-wearing-blazer-plunging-neckline-html.html>Finland's prime minister Sanna Marin is criticised for wearing blazer with a plunging neckline</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lily-chung-suk-wai.html>Home Default - Telly Gupshup</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lily-chung-suk-wai.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
