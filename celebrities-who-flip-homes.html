She says her passion for design and architecture began when she was helping to renovate her own home and now she wants to do it for other people. On "The Kardashians" Kendall has been sharing the early stages of her journey, teaming up with her friend Fai Khadra and searching for the perfect house to take on as their first project.</p><p>"As a model, I still don't have much say in anything creative really. That has brought me to wanting to start this journey of house flipping. I found that I really do want to be my own boss and have my own ideas and execute them," she <a href=#>said</a> on the show, adding, "When I walk into a house, my wheels just kind of start turning, and I'm always like 'I could do this' or 'I could do that.'"</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a></p><p>Over the past 20 years, Ellen DeGeneres has flipped over a dozen houses. With the help of her wife Portia de Rossi, the duo have made millions by taking their purchases and making them even better. Ellen <a href=#>says</a> flipping houses is not just a business venture and is "really a genuine passion" that she hopes to continue for years to come.</p><p>"I think people were kind of really surprised, like 'Ellen's into design?!' But everyone who knows me and who is in my life has known that for a long time," Ellen shared with <a href=#>People</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4fbbc6e6-bdfe-45cd-a194-adbd2a68b9e7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5bd53989-c7e1-43a7-b9fb-a6775ee0fb1d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2022/06/23/873bbb0859b84855b0ab06b5fa040fe7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">9 Celebs Who All Launched Brand New Skincare Lines</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></a></p><p>Jeremy Renner and his friend and business partner Kristoffer Winters have been flipping houses since 2002.

The couple say that they decided they needed another creative outlet when they realized they had already lived in five different houses with their daughter Poppy and she was only 18-months-old. Working on other houses has also given them the opportunity to try out different design styles and help maintain the home's original character.</p><p>"Would I pick a yellow and black bathroom? No. But we're not coming in with a bulldozer just because it's not our color palette. Sometimes you have to update areas and not everything just because it's old. Old can be beautiful," Nate told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Behati Prinsloo</strong></a></p><p>Adam Levine and his wife Behati Prinsloo have dealt with some major real estate in the time that they've been house flipping. In 2017, they <a href=#>sold two properties</a> for a combined $35 million. Then the following year, the couple picked up a $33.9 million home in Beverly Hills and after investing millions into a renovation, they <a href=#>sold it a year later</a> for $45 million. Adam and Behati have continued to flip properties and in 2022, they <a href=#>purchased a Montecito estate</a> and just three months later, sold it for $28.5 million -- $5.8 million more than they had paid.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e8d6e5ed-8cac-432d-a9d2-75d6c9bc0ea6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5bd53989-c7e1-43a7-b9fb-a6775ee0fb1d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cb/5by4/2022/04/20/cb921e10bccb49ec8b187be537970c76_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">12 Actors Who Got Paid Almost Nothing For Their Roles</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Vanilla Ice</strong></a></p><p>Aside from the music industry, Vanilla Ice has made a career in real estate.

Since her parents had previously been involved with real estate, they helped her team up with an architect to develop and put plans together for a new residential building on her college campus. After she graduated, she designed another building at her school.</p><p>Then after finding love with Jordan Rodgers on reality TV, the duo got into house flipping and now have a show called "Cash Pad.” Throughout the first season, the couple fixed up eight different properties ranging from an Airstream trailer to a garage, and then turned them into short-term rentals.</p><a id=gallery-link-51854a11-75cc-456c-8f84-0876cabe5e5d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:51854a11-75cc-456c-8f84-0876cabe5e5d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5bd53989-c7e1-43a7-b9fb-a6775ee0fb1d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fa/4by3/2022/10/18/fae5633890b144728880a49468518590_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma29fmLKtscGroK2hlah6uLTOZp2loaBitbC5xKxm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-who-flip-homes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-kyrsten-sinema-gay-sexuality-partner-and.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-kyrsten-sinema-gay-sexuality-partner-and.html>Is Kyrsten Sinema Gay Sexuality Partner And Dating History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sanjit-das-bio-net-worth-age-sutton-stracke-boyfriend.html>Meet Sanjit Das, Sutton Stracke Boyfriend!
