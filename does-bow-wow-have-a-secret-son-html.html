He dropped the “Lil” and grew up before the public’s eyes, and now has kids of his own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Shad-Moss-2-e1600275424334.jpg><h2>Bow Wow’s family life has been chronicled on TV</h2><p id=par-2_49>Since 2017, Bow Wow has been a main cast member of Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta, which takes viewers into the homes of famous rappers and their families. He has a 9-year-old daughter named Shai with dancer Joie Chavis, who also has a child with fellow rapper Future.</p><h2>Who has Bow Wow been with?</h2><p id=par-3_48>Throughout his public career, Bow Wow has been with different women, and has even been engaged in the past. He dated Ciara from 2004 to 2006, and even revealed in a 2018 episode of Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta that they were secretly engaged for a short period.</p><p id=par-4_55>At one point, Bow Wow — real name Shad Moss — was also engaged to Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta star Erica Mena. He famously dated his <a href=#>106 & Park</a> co-host Angela Simmons in 2013, and has revealed that he lost his virginity to model Esther Baxter when they dated from 2002 to 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-182570796.jpg><h2>Bow Wow kept his daughter a secret for some time</h2><p id=par-5_62>Bow Wow and Joie Chavis kept their daughter under wraps throughout Chavis’ pregnancy, only revealing her existence months after she was born. “My lil girl is betting BIG fast,” he wrote on his website. “I love every minute of it. She inspires me to go harder. Even made me treat my mother better. It’s like it made me into a man overnight.”</p><p id=par-6_72>Gossip sites first published news of his daughter’s birth and he went on the offensive. He defended his decision to wait to go public with the news. “I waited so long to tell y’all the truth because I was nervous on how y’all would look at me,” he said. “Y’all know everyone makes a big deal out of everything I do. I wanted to be 1st n let y’all know the real.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2>Bow Wow addressed the rumors of him having a son</h2><p id=par-7_39>Now, rumors are flying again that Bow Wow has another child he’s trying to keep hidden from the world. He has reportedly had a son with Instagram model Olivia Sky, who claimed that he was her baby’s father.</p><p id=par-8_51>Bow Wow posted a freestyle on his social media titled “D.W.M.O.D. (Dealing With My Own Demons” where he addresses these rumors head-on. “Shai asking me about a brother I don’t know what to say / That’s gon’ be one of them talks that we have face to face,” he raps.</p><p id=par-9_47>He continues, “I’m looking in his eyes, I’m tryna see me in them / I’m peeping out his swag and I see the resemblance / Seen the boy 3 times, sh*t why would I lie? / Baby moms’ll bring him through just so we spend some time.”</p><p id=par-10_76>He concludes that just as was the case with his daughter Shai, he won’t be shying away from parent duties or be an absent father of any kind. “If he mine, sh*t you know I’m steppin’ up / Kobe set that example, you know I send my blessings up,” he admits. “I told you dealing with me was gone be hard to do / We both caught in this storm but we gon’ make it through.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLHSZpmor12svLh5x5qtnmWRYsCmr9Geq2arn6N7qcDMpWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-bow-wow-have-a-secret-son-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gary-coleman-spent-final-days-squalid-blood-stained-house-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gary-coleman-spent-final-days-squalid-blood-stained-house-html.html>Gary Coleman spent final days in squalid blood-stained house</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./63e2bcd522601ddd548b45f2-html.html>Ana Prez sali del tnel en que la meti una lesin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./63e2bcd522601ddd548b45f2-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
