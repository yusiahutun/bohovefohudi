Now a simple operation can have patients back on their feet within hours.</span><p><span>Sheelagh Moss, 67, a retired teacher from Shaftesbury, Dorset, tells CAROL DAVIS her story, while her surgeon explains the procedure.</span></p><p><span><span style=text-decoration:underline;background-color:#fff>THE PATIENT</span></span></p><p><span>Since I'm not very tall, just 5ft 4in, I've always loved high heels - I don't feel dressed without them. I lived in stilettos in my 20s, and as a primary school teacher I'd spend hours on my feet wearing them.</span></p><p><span>But around five years ago, my feet became very painful. I'd start the day in high heels, but would have to change into flats after an hour because my toes and the ball of my foot were throbbing with pain. There was also an angry red bunion on the side of my left big toe and calluses developed on my others because the big toe was pushing the other toes sideways.</span></p><span></span><p><span>Even walking in flat shoes started to hurt - after half an hour I'd have to take off my shoes and socks and rub my feet, even in a shopping centre.</span></p><p><span>I'd planned to take up ballroom dancing in retirement, but this was impossible as painkillers didn't really work.</span></p><p><span>My GP referred me to a general surgeon who agreed I had a troublesome bunion, but warned an operation could cause more problems, although he didn't specify what. He suggested I switch to soft leather shoes, and sent me to the hospital's prosthetic department for special inserts to protect my toes.</span></p><p><span>But when the prosthetics specialist saw my feet, he said they looked so painful that he couldn't understand how I was still walking. He told me I needed to see a foot and ankle surgeon.</span></p><p><span>Since we were living in the Midlands at the time and I'd had a neck operation five years before at the Priory Hospital in Birmingham, I rang them. I saw the foot and ankle surgeon Mark Herron in January 2004. He told me I had arthritis in my left big toe and also the next one. I wasn't surprised - my mother and sister had similar problems.</span></p><p><span>Mr Herron explained that the cartilage, which acts as protective padding, had worn away. This was causing pain because the bones were rubbing against each other when I walked.</span></p><p><span>I love walking in the countryside, but this had become too painful. Because the arthritis was affecting my life so much, Mr Herron suggested surgery. The bunion was being caused by the bones in my toes moving out of position and slanting to the left.</span></p><p><span>He could operate to fuse the painful joint at the base of the big toe, and the one next to it, in the correct position. This would be done by putting metal screws into the toe to stop the middle toe joint bending.</span></p><p><span>It wouldn't affect my walking, as the joint at the very tip of the toe would still move and act as a lever instead. This would pull the toes back in line, so the damaged bones wouldn't rub together and the bunion would disappear.</span></p><p><span>I had the operation the following week. When I woke from the general anaesthetic, there was a bandage on my left foot, but no pain. I was sent home with painkillers the next day.</span></p><p><span>For the first six weeks I wore a stiffened open-toed sandal to keep pressure off my toes and used crutches.</span></p><p><span>My foot was still stiff when I saw Mr Herron six months later, but he said this is common. I could walk normally, but had to wear flat shoes one size too big.</span></p><p><span>After nine months, I could wear a 5cm heel and shop for hours. Two months after that, I was wearing my favourite 10cm heels without any pain.</span></p><p><span>Just over a year ago I had my right foot done as well, as this had become very bad. Now I'm back to my active lifestyle again and have started ballet classes - I can even stand on my tiptoes!</span></p><p><span><span>THE SURGEON</span><br></span></p><p><span><span style=font-style:italic>Mr MARK HERRON is consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon at the Foot and Ankle Clinic at The Priory Hospital, Birmingham. </span></span><span><br></span></p><p><span><span>He says... </span><span>Osteoarthritis of the big toe, or hallux rigidus as it is also known, is a common condition.<br></span></span></p><p><span>It can be hereditary and although normal activities such as walking, dancing and wearing heels do not cause it, they can put pressure on damaged joints and make the pain worse.</span></p><p><span>The condition is simply a result of wear and tear on this joint, so the cartilage which cushions it wears away and the underlying bone thickens. The joint can develop bony outgrowths which jar against each other and cause pain. If the foot bones slide sideways, the head of the big toe bone can also protrude sideways as a bunion, which rubs on shoes.</span></p><p><span>Patients can help themselves by avoiding narrow-fitting shoes and high heels, which can make the pain worse. They can also wear light walking boots, which effectively cradle the joint and stop it bending when they push off in walking.</span></p><p><span>In the early stages, doctors can inject steroids into the joint to reduce the inflammation, which works in up to 80 per cent of cases. If we catch it early enough, we can also use keyhole surgery to remove any loose areas of cartilage or bone growths.</span></p><p><span>Alternatively, we can operate to fuse the joint at the base of the big toe so that it cannot move, which gets rid of the pain for good - it is no longer a moving joint, where bone is grinding on bone and causing pain. This operation has a success rate of up to 95 per cent and should not affect the patient's mobility once the joint has healed.</span></p><p><span>Big toe fusion takes up to 45 minutes. With the patient under general anaesthetic, we inject a long-acting local anaesthetic into the foot so the patient will be free of pain for up to 24 hours.</span></p><p><span>First, I make an incision of up to 7cm down the inner side of the foot and expose the joint. Then I scoop out any bony growths. I realign the toe carefully into the position it should be, so that the head of the bone is no longer sticking out sideways.</span></p><p><span>Straightening the toe, so the tip of it is in line with the ball of the foot and heel, means that the foot will make good contact with the ground again and make walking easier.</span></p><p><span>I position the toe with temporary wires, then fix the joint permanently in place with 4cm titanium screws - each goes in diagonally, so they form a long X shape. In Sheelagh's case, I also fused the next toe which was also damaged, straightening it and fixing it with a screw.</span></p><p><span>The patient can usually put weight on the foot immediately after the operation, but most prefer to use crutches for the first few weeks while the joint heals.</span></p><p><span>Once the wound has healed, the arthritis has gone for good and the patient is free from pain and can resume normal activities - wearing high heels shouldn't cause a problem. I'm delighted to hear Sheelagh is dancing again.</span></p><p>*<i> </i><i>The operation costs £4,500 privately - a similar cost to the NHS.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6Gybn2QbmpubGVklm6uyKBkraeVYq%2BwusSsZJ%2Bto5qxbnmoZq6emaJiwLW1y56rraejYq6orcinZaGsnaE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-big-toe-bones-fused-i-wear-stilettos-again-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./5-letter-words.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./5-letter-words.html>List of 5 Letter Words Starting With 'bro'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-watch-rangers-capitals-game-live.html>How to Watch Rangers vs Capitals Game Live For Free: Where to Stream</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-watch-rangers-capitals-game-live.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
