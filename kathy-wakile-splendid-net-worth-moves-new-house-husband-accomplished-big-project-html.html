However, it is not always the drama; there are some moments of happiness and jubilant one too. In one such moment, Kathy Wakile just moved to her recently completed the big project for a new home. Know about her new house and also her incredible net worth? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>A Big Project:</h2><p>Kathy Wakile and her family are the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">new owners of a Franklin Lake Home in New Jersey</a>. Rich Wakile, Kathy’s husband, had bought the lot, where the house presently stands, back in 2013. Kathy and her husband have given a lot of effort to build the house from the ground-up.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#OMJ</a> Open House: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@KathyWakile</a> gives us an exclusive tour of her stunning new home <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://t.co/HGmwl9PMCa</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/ehb4CP17PU</a> — OMJ (@omjfeed) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 9, 2016</a></p><p>In a video, Kathy had invited ‘OMJ’ for an open house to give a proper inside view of her new house. After completion of months of building and renovating, they completed the new house and moved in on December 23 just in time to throw a Christmas party the very next day. It was a kind of a house warming party as well with almost 80 guests attending.</p><p><strong>Caption: (from left) Kathy's daughter, Victoria, son, Joseph, husband, Rich and Kathy Wakile celebrating Christmas.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A brief look of the house shows us that it radiates with a certain type of ‘outdoor indoor’ feeling with wide windows and hidden stairways. It has a highly efficient kitchen for the chef-housewife and has no cabins for better visibility around the house. The pool is clearly visible from inside because of the whole outdoor indoor idea.</p><p><strong>Caption: Kathy Wakile’s displaying new home in her ‘Open house’</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>It is only natural for the Wakile couple to feel proud of what they have achieved after all the hard work.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"We're really, really proud that we accomplished it and relieved because it was a big project," Kathy added. "A lot of couples can't handle it. But we're really relieved.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2>Nostalgic of the Old House:</h2><p>It must be hard leaving one’s former home, especially if you were&nbsp;attached to it for around 2 decades?&nbsp;</p><p>But for Kathy, “I don't get too attached like that, it's kind of weird. I get more attached to the memories and the people in our family. So hopefully we'll build a new set of memories in this new house."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Plus according to her, the time she spent on constructing her old house has been enough to make it more familiar.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The couple had put up their old house</a>, A four bedroom colonial New Jersey abode, on the market in October 2015 for 799,900 dollars as reported by ‘NJ.com’. The couple had bought the house in 1995 at a price of 340,000 dollars with 17,710 dollars annual tax. They found a buyer in December and although the selling price was not disclosed, it was close to the asked price according to their real estate agent. It looks like they enjoyed the last of their stay in the house. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Almost a Divorce (Married Life and Husband):</h2><p>The couple seems like a great team as per the great house that they have created&nbsp;together, but even the greatest teams have disputes between them. Similarly, in 2013 there were rumors of a divorce between Kathy and her husband.</p><p>Later as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview with ‘Huff Post’ on May 30, 2013</a>, Kathy addressed the rumors by saying that all couples have fights and conflicts. The fact that they had a huge fight regarding a business project that they are both working on doesn’t mean things will be directly leading to divorce. The couple lives happily today, and there is a very unlikely probability of their divorce.</p><p><strong>Caption: Kathy Wakile looking happy with husband Rich Wakile</strong>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Net Worth and Salary:</h2><p>Kathy Wakile must have an amazing net worth for buying such property. It turns out that she has a net worth of estimated 5 million dollars. Her salary is still unknown.</p><p>She has a lot of sources for her earnings. Besides being on her show ‘RHONY’ she also follows a culinary career. She is the author of a cookbook ‘Indulge’. She is also a cannoli entrepreneur and has launched 3 product lines.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kathy Wakile</a> was born on October 4, 1965, in Paterson, New Jersey. Kathy Walkie joined ‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’ in its third series in May 2011. Besides being a housewife, Kathy is also a chef, cookbook author, and entrepreneur. One of her most recent updates has been an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">‘NJ.com’ article on 28th July 2016 </a>about her closet’s description.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqSZpJ3GbsPApKClnV2ova2xzZ2gnWWemsFuw86rq6FlnaTDpr%2BMp5ywZZikwrSxjKGsrJqRo7FurcKcpqaonJ7AqbHDZpmin12lv7C2xJyrZ6Ckork%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkathy-wakile-splendid-net-worth-moves-new-house-husband-accomplished-big-project-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-chinas-fabulous-cross-dressing-computer-coders.html>Meet Chinas fabulous cross-dressing computer coders</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kalki-2898-ad-makers-of-prabhas-amitabh-bachchan-deepika-padukones-action-film-to-treat-fans-with-surprise-on-this-date-1297684.html>Kalki 2898 AD: Makers of Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone's action film to treat fans wit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kalki-2898-ad-makers-of-prabhas-amitabh-bachchan-deepika-padukones-action-film-to-treat-fans-with-surprise-on-this-date-1297684.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
