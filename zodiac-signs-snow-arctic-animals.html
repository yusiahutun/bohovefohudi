<time>30 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Life is full of ups and downs, as well as peaks and valleys. The heat of summer always descends into the cold of winter, which is why it’s time to discuss <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the arctic animal that captures each zodiac sign</a> the most. After all, everyone has their own unique way of dealing with the snow, and while some of us may be more prone to hiding and planning, others may be more suited to hunting and competing.</p><p>Located at the northernmost locations on Earth, the arctic contains a cold that is bone-deep and unyielding. Even though the sun barely ever sets there during the summer, the arctic always retains its frozen front. This region—which stretches from the icy coastlines of Alaska to the tallest peaks of Mt&nbsp;Gunnbjörn in Greenland to the wilds of Russia—contains an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>animal kingdom that is entirely its own</a>. The creatures that live here have adapted to these harsh and frigid climates, making them patient, resilient, and courageous in their own right. These animals <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>represent the parts of our spirit</a> that can withstand even life’s most difficult challenges, as hardships cannot be avoided, no matter how hard we try. By tapping into the animal that aligns with your winter spirit the most, you can remember that you, too, are capable of surviving the seemingly unsurvivable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-2.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-arctic-animal-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Arctic Animal That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>If you’re currently dreaming of making snow angels and putting up your Christmas decorations, here’s the arctic animal that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reflects your zodiac sign</a> the most:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Aries: You're the Orca</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-150031008.jpg><p>The ocean’s top predator is the orca and Aries is the most fierce and aggressive zodiac sign of all. Ruled by Mars—planet of action and primal energy—you might reduce Aries to nothing more than impulsivity and brute force, but the truth is, their war tactics are far more intelligent than they seem. While an orca is certainly certainly strong enough to dominate their prey, they would rather engage in sophisticated and highly coordinated hunting strategies with their fellow pack members, capturing seals, squid, and even other dolphins. Taking down enemies is fun for an Aries, just like an orca enjoys playing with their food.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Taurus: You’re the Musk Ox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1145391397.jpg><p>It doesn’t get more Taurus than the solid, grounded, and immovable musk ox. Taurus is ruled by Venus—goddess of love and natural pleasures—and the musk ox enjoys feeding on moss, roots, lichens, and even flowers. They live in herds comprised of 20 to 30 other animals, always led by a female. This means the musk ox lives in a matriarchal society, which meshes with Taurus energy beautifully. Taurus is a fixed earth sign and their stubborn nature helps them withstand change, much like the long, shaggy hair of a musk ox keeps them insulated during frigid northern winters.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Gemini: You're the Beluga Whale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-104229458.jpg><p>If the phrase “sing like a canary” could be applied to any zodiac sign, it would have to be Gemini. This mutable air sign is by far the most talkative, and if animal can keep up with their conversation, it would be a beluga whale. They, too, are known as the “canary of the sea”, as this silly-sweet sea creature is among the most vocal in the arctic. Beluga whales have three types of sounds—whistles, calls, and echolocation clicks—and they don’t just communicate with their vocal cords. Like a Gemini loves to gesticulate wildly, beluga whales also love to play, chase, and rub against each other.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Cancer: You're the Harp Seal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-10182003.jpg><p>Cancers are ruled by the moon, and if you’re a Cancer rising, you may even look like the moon. The harp seal can relate, as their round face and innocent features are just as lunar. This arctic seal species only leaves the ocean to mate and give birth to pups on beds of ice, highlighting Cancer’s maternal qualities. However, Cancers have just as many moods as the moon has phases, making them just as light-hearted as they are capable of diving into the deep. Although harp seals spend plenty of time on land, they’re also able to swim up to 1,300 feet below the surface and remain underwater for around 16 minutes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Leo: You're the Walrus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-534967474.jpg><p>There may not be lions in the arctic, but there certainly are walruses. This massive pinniped species establishes dominance based on the length of their ivory tusks, which grow longer all throughout their lives. These tusks represent their pride and self-worth, as they’ll even fight and poke each other with these tusks in order to gain the upper-hand. Leo is equally as concerned with maintaining their dignity in social groups, as the thought of not being appreciated for their noble character and sense of humor is this fixed fire sign’s worst nightmare. A walrus may look unapproachable—much like a Leo can seem intimidating—but they also have one of the most gregarious personalities in the animal kingdom.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Virgo: You’re the Narwhal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1470070765.jpg><p>The narwhal is known as the “unicorn of the deep” and since ancient times, the unicorn has represented cleanliness and grace. If any zodiac sign can relate to that association, it would have to be Virgo. This mutable earth sign is symbolized by the “Virgin”, furthering their pure and untarnished persona. Narwhals are also highly social creatures and Mercury—planet of communication—is exalted when moving through Virgo, making it the one zodiac sign that can decipher their underwater language. Like the way a narwhal’s long, spiraled tusk is always aiming forward, a Virgo is equally as eager to get to the point.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Libra: You’re the Tundra Swan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1466403750.jpg><p>There’s no doubt Libra is the most relationship-oriented zodiac sign, and when it comes to arctic animals, none are as monogamous as the tundra swan. Breeding in western Alaska all the way up to the northernmost tips of Canada, this bird species is geared toward finding another swan to mate with for life. Everyone knows a Libra is always looking for their one true love. Libra is also a chatty and musical air sign, which meshes with the way the tundra swan’s wings famously whistle through the air while they’re flying. They also have charming and highly romantic mating rituals that have inspired artists and thinkers all throughout history.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Scorpio: You're the Canada Lynx</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-147018099.jpg><p>The Canada lynx is one of the most secretive and mysterious animals in the arctic. They’re just as difficult to find as a Scorpio when they don’t want to be found. This feline predator is also patient, sneaky, and strategic, as they’re capable of standing in place and waiting for hours until their prey is in the perfect position for them to pounce. Scorpios are ruled by Mars—planet of combat and primal instincts—but they don’t show all their cards immediately. Like the lynx, they would much rather wait until their enemy slips up, swooping in right when they’re least expecting it.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Sagittarius: You’re the Arctic Fox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1454031937.jpg><p>Sagittarius is symbolically tied to the archer, which is why they’re always aiming their arrow directly at what they want to achieve. The arctic fox is equally as obsessed with their target, and because they primarily feed on burrowing lemmings, this canine species is known for diving right into the snow once they’ve zoned in on their prey. Sagittarius is also an adaptable fire sign, capable of changing their appearance to adapt to their surroundings. The arctic fox can relate, as their fur is always snowy white in the winter, but in the summer, their coat evolves to a brownish-grey color in order to blend in with rocks and plants.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Capricorn: You're the Polar Bear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-534967024.jpg><p>Although Capricorns are authoritative warriors, they’re also loving providers, much like polar bears spend nearly 30 months doting on their cubs until they’re ready to fend for themselves. However, like a Capricorn, a polar bear’s affection doesn’t extend to everyone, as they’re also the most dangerous bear species in existence. Mars—planet aggression and combat—is always exalted while moving through Capricorn, which speaks to their ability to take down enemies and maintain control over their surroundings. Like a Capricorn can smell an opportunity from a mile away, a polar bear can also catch the scent of their prey from up to a kilometer away.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aquarius: You’re the Puffin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-595692201.jpg><p>Like an Aquarius always stands out from the crowd, a puffin is one of the most unique birds not just in the arctic, but on planet Earth. Lovingly nicknamed the “sea parrot”, the puffin has specialized beaks and spiny tongues that are geared for fishing, making them capable of catching up to 10 fish in one go. They’re also highly community-oriented and Aquarius is a fixed air sign that thrives when surrounded by likeminded individuals. However, Aquarius is also symbolically tied to the “water bearer” which is why an animal that thrives in the sky just as much as in the ocean would be their perfect counterpart.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9070321811681><h2>Pisces: You're the Greenland Shark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Greenland_shark_profile.jpeg><p>Pisces is the most elusive zodiac sign of all, much like the odds of actually seeing a Greenland shark in the wild are extremely low. And although they’re incredibly slow-moving, they’re actually comparable in size to a great white shark, which matches the way Pisces is ruled by Jupiter, a planet that expands everything it touches. Pisces is also the most ancient in the zodiac and people born under this sign are often old souls. Because scientists believe Greenland sharks may live anywhere between 250 and 500 years, there’s a good chance today’s living Greenland sharks were around during many of your past lives. They’re also capable of swimming in <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>depths of up to 7,218 feet</a>, just like a Pisces always feels things more deeply than any other zodiac sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbr%2FNqK5mmaKYwaqvjJqloqWRocBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snow-arctic-animals.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./5-best-supplements-for-runners.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./5-best-supplements-for-runners.html>5 Best Supplements For Runners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zendaya-green-gown-loewe-challengers-premiere.html>Zendayas Glittery Tennis-Themed Gown Is a Stroke of Genius</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zendaya-green-gown-loewe-challengers-premiere.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
