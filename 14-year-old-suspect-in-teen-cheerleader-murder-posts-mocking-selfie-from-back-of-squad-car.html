The demons are going to take my soul away."</p><p>"What's going on?" he repeatedly asks. "Why am I here? I just want to talk to my mom and dad. What's going on? What's going on?"</p><p>He did not interact with anybody on the line; according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News4Jax </a>which has been closely following the case, his lawyer waived the right to a speedy trial — which is common — moving the next hearing to October 28.</p><p>Forensic psychologist Dr. Justin D'Arienzo, who is not affiliated with the case, told the outlet it was hard to tell if he was faking or not.</p><p>"He definitely looked disoriented and confused. It's hard to tell if he's feigning mental illness or if something is really happening with him," he said. "From my perspective, it seemed genuine, given the pattern of behavior today and from what else we know."</p><p>As yet, the judge has not ordered a mental health competency evaluation; if one is ordered, it could drag the case out for months more.</p><p>Fucci's mother Crystal Smith, who is accused of evidence tampering, also had her hearing moved to October 28; she is currently out on bond.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/4by3/2021/08/25/33759a4483924190b29fa85f93392336_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Snapchat/St. Johns County Sheriff's Office/Instagram/WJXT</span><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-primary">UPDATE 8/25/2021 11:42 AM</p><p>Police have released several new videos in the case against Aiden Fucci.</p><p>One, captured by a home surveillance camera, shows two people walking together shortly after midnight on May 9 — the last time Tristyn Bailey was seen alive.</p><p>According to prosecutors, the suspect and the victim are headed towards the wooded area of their neighborhood where the 13-year-old's mutilated body would later be found.</p><p>Less than two hours later, that same camera captured the person sprinting barefoot — alone — in the opposite direction.</p><p>Separate security footage from Fucci's own home that same night show him returning to his front door barefoot, carrying his trainers in his hand.</p><p>Yet another video from inside Fucci's home allegedly shows his mother, Crystal Smith, attempting to wash blood out of his jeans just hours after Bailey was killed.</p><p>According to an arrest report, both the jeans and the bathroom drain tested positive for blood.</p><p>Smith has also been charged with one felony count of evidence tampering.</p><p>Also among the cache of evidence released Tuesday was some of the infamous Snapchat videos Fucci posted while sat in the back of the police car, in which he addressed Bailey directly.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-primary">UPDATE 7/16/2021 7:30 AM</p><p>Grisly new details have emerged in the horrific murder of 13-year-old cheerleader Tristyn Bailey, who was found stabbed 114 times in Florida on Mother's Day.</p><p>According to new documents released by the 7th Judicial State's Attorney's Office, when police put Aiden Fucci -- the 14-year-old accused of killing Bailey -- into an interrogation room and told him Bailey's body had been found and he was the last to have seen her, he responded, "How is that my problem?"</p><p>Investigators also found bloody clothes and sneakers in Fucci's bedroom, but also a notebook containing "drawings of a violent nature," with one "depicting a Satanic element to them, to include a pentagram."</p><p>Another illustration showed a naked female with red X's over her breasts and genitals, and blood spurting out from severed arms.</p><p>The documents also claim friends of Fucci said he was vocal about wanting to murder someone. "If he were to kill someone, it was going to be planned, he would find a random person walking at night, drag them into the woods, and stab them," a friend told detectives.</p><p>Fucci's girlfriend also told police he would sneak up behind her and pretend to slit her throat with his knives, which he nicknamed "Picker" and "Poker."</p><p>"Aiden knew something was wrong with him and wanted to reach out for help," a friend reportedly said to authorities.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-primary">update at 11:00am on Friday, May 28 2021</p><p>Prosecutors have decided to charge Aiden Fucci -- the 14-year-old Florida teen accused of killing 13-year-old Tristyn Bailey -- as an adult. His charge was also upped to first-degree murder on Thursday.</p><p>During a press conference, State Attorney R.K. Larizza told reporters Fucci told his friends "he intended to kill someone" and "indicated to witnesses that he was going to kill someone by taking them in the woods and stabbing them." Larizza added Fucci "didn't say who that was" and pointed out how that statement fit the "facts of the case."</p><p>"It brings me no pleasure to be charging a 14-year-old as an adult with first-degree murder," he continued. "But I can tell you also the executive team and I reviewed all the facts, all the circumstances, the applicable law and it was not a difficult decision to make, that he should be charged as an adult."</p><p>Grisly new details also emerged in the case, as Larizza revealed Bailey was stabbed 114 times, with 49 defensive stab wounds to the hands, arms and head. The tip of the blade broke off and was "located by the medical examiner in the scalp of our victim."</p><p>"To say that it was horrific could arguably be made as an understatement," Larizza said. "Bottom line, premeditation can be inferred certainly from just the sheer number of stab wounds that Tristyn Bailey had to suffer."</p><p>Fucci hasn't entered a plea -- but the Sheriff's office previously said he changed his story several times during interviews after his arrest and made several "admissions" at the time.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story below</p><p>A 14-year-old posted a selfie from the back of a squad car mocking the teen cheerleader he is suspected of killing, according to police.</p><p>On Monday, Aiden Fucci was arrested and charged with the second-degree murder of 13-year-old Tristyn Bailey, who was found stabbed to death in a remote wooded area of St. Johns, Florida the night before.</p><p>After being taken into custody, the teenager allegedly posted a photo of his reflection in the police car to Snapchat, flashing a peace sign, with the caption: "Hey guys has inybody seen Tristyn lately".
