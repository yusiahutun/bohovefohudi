Here's what you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>James saw his child's name grow into a household name in the United States. He had a role to play as a father and played an instrumental role in helping Nick Cannon become a stand-up comedian. Here are interesting facts about him:</p><h3>1. James was a teenager when Nick Cannon was born</h3><p class=align-left>As of 2023, James Cannon's age is 60. He was born in 1963. But when he was 17, he welcomed his first son, Nick Cannon. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met Nick Cannon’s mother</a> on 1 January 1980 at a friend’s house. The duo interacted for a while and began a relationship.</p><p class=align-left>On 17 January 1980, James received the news that the girl was pregnant. He was born on 8 October 1980. But who is Nick Cannons' real mother? His mother is Beth Gardner. She is an American accountant. Beth Gardner has appeared with her son at many awards in the past.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5e02fdd125a25c39.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hans Walters story: What really happened and where is he now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b6761bcd83729ba.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite the birth of their son, James and Beth Gardner did not stay together. They were young, and Beth wanted to do other things for herself. When Nick was two months old, the duo allowed Nick’s grandparents to care for him. So, they raised him in Lincoln Park's Bay Vista Housing Projects and took him to Monte Vista <a href=#>High School</a> in Spring Valley.</p><h3>2. He is pro-life</h3><p class=align-left>James encourages his son to have as many children as possible because he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pro-life. </a>In 2021, James could not tell how many grandchildren he had, especially the number of children Nick Cannon had. Nick Cannon had seven children at that time.</p><p class=align-left>James believes that children are a blessing. So he also never minds the number of women his son has impregnated as long as he asks the <a href=#>right questions</a>. His beliefs in life have allowed him to have five children. Besides Nick, his other four children are Gabriel, Reuben, Javen, and Caleb. But James Cannon did not have the other four children with Nick Cannon’s mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68c7627c338671c1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Frank Gotti? The life and tragedy of John Gotti's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After they separated when Nick was two months old, he went and had a relationship with an unnamed woman. Nevertheless, he advises his son Nick to make as much money as he can because taking care of his children will be a huge responsibility. As of 2023, Nick Cannon has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">12 children</a>.</p><h3>3. James Cannon is a millionaire</h3><p class=align-left>Nick Cannon has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50 million.</a> He makes money through salaries for acting and appearing in reality TV shows. Also, Nick’s sources of income include:</p><ul><li>Album sales</li><li>Comedy</li><li>Revenues from streaming his music</li><li>Royalties</li><li>Endorsements</li></ul><p class=align-left>Nick Cannon receives an annual salary of $20 million. But does Nick Cannon come from a rich <a href=#>family</a>? He did not grow up in a wealthy family. His father was a teenager, which forced his grandfather to raise him in <a href=#>housing projects</a> in San Diego.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b852b8c4acd9f937.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What really happened to James King from My-600-Lb Life?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are Nick Cannon's parents billionaires? No. However, Nick’s father got his act together and became a televangelist. He also works at his son’s foundation, Nick Cannon Inc. As of 2023, James Cannon's net worth is $24 million.</p><h3>4. He had a troublesome past</h3><p class=align-left>James Cannon grew up with his son in Lincoln Park's Bay Vista Housing Projects. The Lincoln Park area is notorious for being the home of a street gang called Lincoln Park Bloods. James was one of the founding members of the Lincoln Park Bloods. His association with the gang almost affected his son, Nick Cannon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5e02fdd125a25c39.png><p class=align-left>Nick Cannon tried to get away from the gang. He revealed that he lost a lot of friends through gang violence. But Nick remained in school and <a href=#>earned his degree </a>from Howard University. On the other hand, James Cannon’s association with the gang saw him go to prison. However, he repented his sins and gave his life to Christ. Eventually, he became an evangelist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f5cb3ef9eadb89b3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ava Berlin Renner?

He is alive in 2023</h3><p class=align-left>In 2016, Nick Cannon wrote a tribute on his Instagram page about the death of his ‘pops.’ So, many people quickly pointed out that Nick referred to his father. But that was not true. The person that<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> died in 2016</a> was James Cannon Sr., Nick Cannon’s grandfather. When Nick’s father was 17, he could not raise his child. So, he left the responsibility to his grandfather.</p><p class=align-left>Nick Cannon always referred to his grandfather as the father. Likewise, he always referred to his aunts as sisters. Thus, when his grandfather passed away in 2016, he still called him Pops. James Cannon Jr. is still alive in 2023 and even gave an interview in 2021.</p><p class=align-left>James Cannon is an American televangelist, author, and philanthropist widely known as the father of Nick Cannon. He has five children, Nick Cannon, Gabriel Cannon, Reuben Cannon, Javen Cannon, and Caleb Cannon. James welcomed Nick Cannon when he was 17 years old.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54cf2e46b80d38c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wylda Rae Johnson: Everything about Aaron Taylor-Johnson's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an interesting article about <a href=#>Gabe Kunda</a>.
