The original show follows couples who have received a K-1 visa, which is uniquely available to betrothed partners of US citizens.&nbsp;The Other Way&nbsp;is exactly what it sounds like—American couples who move to their partner’s home country. “It’s about love,”&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;executive producer,&nbsp;Matt Sharp, told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Gold Derby</a>&nbsp;in May 2022 when asked what makes the&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;reality TV&nbsp;series so popular.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shawn-alliya-90-day-fiance.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alex-adriano-90-day.png><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id=related-who-s-still-together-from-90-day-fiance-love-in-paradise-what-we-know-about-the-s4-couples><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: Who’s Still Together From&nbsp;90 Day Fiance Love in Paradise?

One is that this show is incredibly authentic. I’m a huge lover of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;and that franchise, however, we were one of the first shows to actually tell real stories about ordinary Americans and their love journeys. Also, this show is about this journey with other cultures. When we launched this show in 2014, we were on the ‘love frontier’ of this whole new era of finding people all over the world.”</p><p>He continued: “This is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the most diverse show on television</a>,” Sharp asserted. “You can challenge me on it. We featured people from 51 countries at this point. We have subtitles. We have people that don’t speak the same language and have completely different cultures. We’re trying to tell unique stories every time and when we’re in the casting process we’re evaluating people based on their personalities, backgrounds and their stories, but also we just want to tell unique, fresh, interesting stories.”</p><p>He also explained that the show has no say in the visa process or anything like that. “This is an authentic process,” he explains. “We make a point of having an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>arm’s length with that process</a>. We’ll check in and say, ‘How’s it going?’ Are there people that we have said, ‘Wouldn’t it be great for the show?” and then a fiancé went through the visa process and they got denied and we didn’t feature them? Of course.” But of course, you can be excited about the drama&nbsp;and&nbsp;want to know how everything ends. Here’s if Kyle and Anika are still together from 90 Day Fiance: Love In Paradise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-kyle-and-anika-still-together-from-90-day-fiance-love-in-paradise>Are Kyle and Anika still together from&nbsp;90 Day Fiance: Love In Paradise?</h2><p>We have to assume they’re still together because they both still follow each other on social media, even though neither posts about the other. In a post she shared on March 26, 2024,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>he liked it</a>, but she hasn’t liked any of his social media activity, which is giving us a little pause. Still, we’ll have to wait to see how this pans out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>According to TLC, this couple has a less-than-conventional relationship. “By day, Kyle is a&nbsp;seemingly traditional&nbsp;guy who works as an accountant. His real passion and hobby, however, is donating sperm. Kyle has 71 children and nine on the way from donating sperm to women around the world,” their official bio reads. “Anika, a single mother who wants to have another child, saw Kyle’s donation information online and booked a consultation call with him. Ever since their first conversation, they both felt a spark, but slowly the conversation changed from donating to dating! Now Kyle will travel to the beautiful island of Malta to meet Anika for the first time. But will he stop donating for good to be with Anika?”</p><p>In June 2023, Kyle announced his retirement from sperm donation but he’s seemingly returned to it since. “I’m not that active [with donating] right now, as it’s no longer a focus for me,” Kyle, who runs the website Be Pregnant Now, told NeedToKnow.co.uk. “I want a relationship with someone and that’s the most important thing to me at the moment.”</p><p>He added: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">I’m going to stop donating</a>—except for a select few—I won’t be helping so often, as I need to look at building that meaningful connection with someone who likes me, for me. It’s OK for people to contact me if they’d like a relationship, but where donating is concerned, I’ll only be helping those who really want a baby.”</p><p>Kyle also revealed that his unconventional hobby has been a source of relationship strain before. “The woman couldn’t accept the fact that I was still donating and said it wouldn’t work long-term,” he said. “I need to find someone special who can accept me and what I have done in the past, but I don’t want that to get in the way anymore. Maybe in a few months, if I don’t find anyone, I’ll be my old self. But if I do find someone, I’ll re-evaluate my hobby entirely.”</p><p>He added: “If my girlfriend only wants me to donate once or twice a month or perhaps even pick the people who I donate to, then I would need to have a long discussion with them about my situation. I’ll agree to certain rules and make sacrifices for the right woman who I can make a wife.”</p><p><strong>90 Day Fiance: Love In Paradise&nbsp;airs on Mondays at 8 pm EST on TLC.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lnBna2poZLi6uMRmmKehm5Z6tMDIpaNmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtkcmhdma66ecWimKeblWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyle-anika-still-together-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./greg-fishel-bio-wiki-salary-relationship-parents-age-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./greg-fishel-bio-wiki-salary-relationship-parents-age-height.html>Greg Fishel Bio Wiki, Salary, Relationship, Parents, Age, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sweetie-fox-actress-age-height-videos-biography-weight-wikipedia-and-more.html>Sweetie Fox (Actress) Age, Height, Videos, Biography, Weight, Wikipedia and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sweetie-fox-actress-age-height-videos-biography-weight-wikipedia-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
