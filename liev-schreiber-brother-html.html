Liev’s parents chose the legal procedure to decide his custody, which was in favor of his mother. His mother, after the split, chose to become a cab driver and raised her living that way.</p><p>Liev's mother did her best to raise her son to become a responsible adult despite tough times.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>However, there was an instance when Liev stole from his mother to buy sneakers.</p><p>As he grew older, raised by a single mother, he embraced acting and shaped his life towards prosperity.</p><p>But, on the other hand, his father lived alongside his half-brothers, <a href=# rel=follow>Pablo Schreiber</a>, Max, Will, Charles, and his rumored half-sister, Charlie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Keep reading&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Aaron Donald's Sweet Relation with Brother, Sister & Parents</a></strong></p><p>Nothing much about his sister has ever come to light, but all of his half-brothers made their appearance in Hollywood.</p><p>However, Max, Will, and Charles are not as active in the entertainment industry.

Liev and his brother first met when Pablo was sixteen, unknown that both of them would mark their presence as the biggest stars in Hollywood one day.</p><p>Their father, Tell, inspired both the brothers to try their feet in acting, as their father belonged to the same professional background. Moreover, he had influenced his kids that drove them to Hollywood.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Liev Schreiber alongside his half-brother, Pablo Schreiber (Image Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">E!
