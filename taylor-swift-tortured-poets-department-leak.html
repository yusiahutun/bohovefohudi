But <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a>‘s Tortured Poets Department leaked online two days before its scheduled release—or did it?</p><p>The “Anti-hero” singer said in her speech for Best Pop Vocal Album: “Okay, this is my 13th Grammy, which is&nbsp;<a href=#>my lucky number</a>. I don’t know if I’ve ever told you that. I want to say thank you to the members of the Recording Academy for voting this way, but I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I have been keeping from you for the last two years.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-birthday-decorations.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-Charlie-Puth.png><p>On Monday, February 5, 2024, the day after announcing her new album “two years in the making” would be out on April 19, the vinyl tracklist dropped including some of her collaborators.</p><p><strong>Side A</strong><br>Fortnight (feat.

Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=did-taylor-swift-s-tortured-poets-department-leak>Did Taylor Swift’s Tortured Poets Department leak?</h2><p>On Wednesday, April 17, 2024, Swifties everywhere flooded social media claiming that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift’s Tortured Poets Department leaked</a>, with some revealing that they had been taken from a Google Drive link containing the entire 17-song list. DailyMail.com <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reported seeing a screenshot</a> from a Swifties group chat in which a file containing the allegedly leaked album has been shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/torturedpoetssongs.png><p>Upon hearing some of these leaked tracks though, some are definitely not Taylor Swift—and some fans believe the tracks have been mocked up with the power of AI. Seeing #TTPD trending on X (formerly Twitter), some fans have obviously felt compelled to capitalize with gag shares, too, including a cover of “London Bridge Is Falling Down” as a ruse to get people to play and share.</p><p>Another featured a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>vocalist that sounds like Swift</a>, but whoever it is is singing the lyrics to “Renegade” by Big Red Machine—i.e. not a Swift song. This could be created rather easily using AI technology.</p><p>Many fans took to social media to rally against the leak after it was confirmed that The Tortured Poets Department was indeed leaked. “Tip: Turn Your Device’s Volume COMPLETELY OFF on Twitter for the NEXT 24 HRS and REPORT EVERY POST spamming about album leaks! We got this!” one fan posted on X. “Raise your hand if you’re an ACTUAL Taylor Swift fan and aren’t listening,” wrote one social media user. A user <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/redvermorekat/status/1780769278230487144>replied</a>, “People need to understand that this isn’t just about being a fan. It’s about respecting others of their hard work! She and her team has planned and worked so meticulously for this album release, don’t disrespect and ruin it for others as well.” Fans are also burying the link by spamming the hashtag on the site.</p><p>When the tracklist was shared, fans’ reactions to the song titles were strong because at least half of the songs are believed to be about her relationship and breakup from Joe Alwyn, whom she dated for 6 years. “Joe Alwyn count your days,” one fan&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>tweeted</a>. “Every song title from The Tortured Poets Department is bad for Joe Alwyn,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>another agreed</a>. Another said Joe would be “entering witness protection” once the album is released, while&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>another wrote</a>, “just remembered that when i wake up on april 19th i will not have to endure what joe alwyn will have to endure.”</p><p>Then again, there have been some die-hard Swifties who aren’t so keen on the collection. “She’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>going to release this</a>. Joe is going to continue to pay her dust, and it’ll continue to drive her insane,” one wrote. “babe i thought this was the hapPIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN what happened???” another said. “saw the leak for this a few hours ago and immediately wrote it off as fake 😭 wtf are these titles,” another wrote.</p><p>An insider told the Daily Mail that it’s raised alarm bells for Alwyn, particularly with the name which is likely a reference to the group chat, The Tortured Man Club, with which he shares with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/April-8-2023-Taylor-Swift-and-Joe-Alwyn-break-up.png><p>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Joe has not said one word about Taylor</a>&nbsp;or their breakup and has been completely respectful of her. It’s undeniable that the name of her upcoming album is in reference to Joe’s WhatsApp group chat,” the source said. “Taylor knocked him for the name of this when they were together. She didn’t want people to think that it had anything to do with her, so when he spoke out about it, she was, of course, bothered.”</p><p>The insider continued, “Joe has no reason to believe yet that she is going to diss him or their relationship. She writes about her past using code and points of reference. It may just be that she is reflecting on their time together and he is hoping it is nothing more.”</p><p>They concluded: “If it is a diss album, that is shady. He helped her with songwriting on her past album so it will really come as a shock to him if she talks about their breakup, as it is something he has not spoken of at all. Regardless of what she does, he will still not respond because he has removed himself from her narrative and is very glad, he did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylorswiftlyrics.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuQcGxtamNsfLWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIytpquspaeypXnPqJytq12ZsrGt0a2knqakYrmmrcpo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-leak.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charli-damelio-landon-barker-tattoo-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charli-damelio-landon-barker-tattoo-html.html>Charli DAmelio and Landon Barker's New Tattoos Fuel Dating Rumors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tiktok-sisters-mcdonalds-unforgivable-food-hack-makes-fans-feel-sick.html>TikTok sisters' McDonald's unforgivable 'food hack' makes fans 'feel sick'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tiktok-sisters-mcdonalds-unforgivable-food-hack-makes-fans-feel-sick.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
