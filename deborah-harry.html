She ventured into singing with folk band in 1968, but it was meeting - and falling in love with guitarist Chris Stein that would change her life forever.</p><p id=eTaDQ75930I data-wc=96>In 1974 the two formed and, after a lengthy struggle to break into the mainstream, the band became one of the biggest pop acts of its generation. Singles like and would make Blondie and in particular its singer huge stars on both sides of the Atlantic. Unlike other blonde starlets, Deborah also earned a reputation as a wild rock'n'roller. Her hellraising adventures brought her no small amount of media attention. "Absolutely we were smashing dressing rooms, hotels, bashing each other," she admits. "Why? I don't know. Zeal?"</p><p id=eQRKRX4VU9A data-wc=87>The band's wild partying was sustained by several years of chart-topping success. They were riding the crest of a wave, but it all came to an abrupt end in 1982. Their sixth album, was a commercial flop and Chris became seriously ill with the genetic disease pemphigus. Blondie collapsed and Deborah split her time between caring for her partner and developing a solo career. He eventually recovered but their relationship was suffering and the singer suffered yet another blow when their long-running romance fell apart.</p><p id=eM4NwVerq0K data-wc=53>While she never reached the heights of stardom that she found with , Debbie has proven herself with solid performances in films like <i>Videodrome, Hairspray</i> and more recently <i>Deuces Wild.&nbsp;</i> She appeared in a steady stream of movie productions through the nineties, and released three solo albums, most notably <i>Deaf, Dumb and Blonde.</i></p><p id=ep_uASJ9yv6 data-wc=96>She had proven herself as an artist in her own right, but it was perhaps inevitable that would re-form. One last tour and, of course, one last album followed in 1999 when die-hard fans were treated to <i>No Exit,</i> the final release. These days Deborah's more focussed on modern jazz outfit The Jazz Passengers, however. The group may not be selling millions of records, but they have gained a committed following and the respect of their musical peers. Even London's Barbican Centre admits that the one-time "Princess of Punk" is rapidly becoming a 21st-century diva.</p><h2>Deborah Harry's personal life</h2><p id=eN66EJvFO3 data-wc=104>Deborah's mother was a respected concert pianist, but the musician did not feel ready to bring up a child and so a home and family had to be found for the future star. She was adopted by a New Jersey couple but insists that she inherited her biological mother's musical talent. "It's genetic - I was always going to be an artist, in one field or another, come hell or high water." And it would seem that both hell and high water were lying in wait. Asked about the difficult times in her past, she jokes: "Which bad period? I've had quite a few."</p><p id=eEXz-VJSsN data-wc=50>In a 2011 interview, Deborah said that "After witnessing <a aria-label="Elton John" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Elton John</a> and his tireless efforts against <a aria-label=HIV/AIDS class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>HIV/AIDS</a>", she had been inspired to make philanthropy her top priority. She said, "These things are important to my life now. I have the privilege of being able to get involved, so I do."<br></p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ucGJksaauzquYoWWYlr%2BzxY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdeborah-harry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./faith-hill-youngest-daughter-bikini-photo-leaves-fans-wondering-same-thing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./faith-hill-youngest-daughter-bikini-photo-leaves-fans-wondering-same-thing.html>Faith Hill's youngest daughter's bikini photo leaves fans wondering the same thing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cardi-b-street-style-outfit-suit.html>Cardi B's Street Style Suit Look Is Chic as Hell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cardi-b-street-style-outfit-suit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
