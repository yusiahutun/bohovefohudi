But, the truth is there are certain qualities in people that make us fall in love with them in the first place. So, the next time you want to make your partner feel special, let your partner know exactly why you are so crazy about them by including ‘reasons why I love you’ in your love note.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding reasons can also be very reassuring and drown out any doubt that your partner may have about your affection for them. After all, who doesn't want to hear about why they are valued and loved as they are? It can only be a gorgeous and affirming feeling. So, don’t hesitate to write a long love note or text with all the details about why your partner’s got your heart all warm and mushy.
