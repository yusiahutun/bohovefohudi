K. Rowling, it is a remarkably modest home. Set down a dusty dirt trail, the four-bedroom property blends seamlessly into the desert landscape - low and sand-coloured with just a few cacti for decoration. Only a high-tech camera and newly installed metal gates give some hint of the occupant's desire for privacy.</p><p>Here, in the remote town of Cave Creek, Arizona, is where Stephenie Meyer chooses to live, in a house she has shared with her husband and three children for the past decade.</p><p>A cursory glance at the bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic shows Meyer is, as Time magazine declared, 'the publishing phenomenon of the new century'.</p><p>At various points this year, all five of her published books - four in the hugely successful Twilight series of vampire romance novels and one work of adult science-fiction - have been in the Top 10 in both Britain and the United States.</p><p>Last year Meyer sold an astonishing 27million books in 37 countries - eclipsing even the Harry Potter series - and when a film version of Twilight was released starring British heart-throb Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, it made more than £200million worldwide. There seems little doubt that the sequel, New Moon, will set new records when it is released next week.</p><p>To date, Meyer, a 35-year-old Mormon who started writing only five years ago, is said to have amassed a fortune of more than £50million. Yet little is known about the slightly plump brunette.<br></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/12/article-1227261-02BFB085000005DC-569_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Tourism in Washington's Twilight town increases by 1000 per cent</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/12/article-1227377-0702BB5D000005DC-159_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Twilight crush: Help!

She is a private person and hates all the attention. She is doing mum things at the moment and writing, of course, which is what her millions of fans will be delighted to hear.'<br></p><p>According to the official account of her life, Meyer had no aspirations to be anything other than a housewife until one day when she woke from a dream about a beautiful, breathless teenager standing in a meadow opposite a young man - a vampire - torn between his love for the girl and his desire to, quite literally, consume her.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/15/article-1227754-0719DDFA000005DC-419_468x304.jpg height=304 width=468 alt="Robert Pattinson with Kristen Stewart in New Moon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Deadly kiss: British actor Robert Pattinson stars as a vampire with Kristen Stewart in the new Twilight film, New Moon</p><p>Meyer spent the next three months writing Twilight, in which vampire Edward falls for the chaste heroine Bella Swan. Meyer often worked all night and then shared each chapter with her elder sister, Emily.</p><p>When the 498-page manuscript was finished, she was going to put it in a drawer and forget about it but, at her sister's urging, sent it to several publishers.</p><p>A canny editor pulled the book from a pile on her desk and, having read it on a plane, was so entranced by the story that Meyer was offered a three-book deal worth £500,000 on the spot.</p><p>This remarkable story is made even more so by Meyer's apparently ordinary lifestyle. In her hometown (population: 4,900), locals say she is rarely seen without the company of one of her three sons - Gabe, 11, Seth, eight, and Eli, six - or Christian, her husband of 15 years.</p><p>Cave Creek is a slightly run-down old frontier town which now serves as a tourist spot for travellers driving through the sun-scorched Sonoran Desert on their way to the Grand Canyon. Souvenir stalls selling cowboy hats, boots and spurs sit alongside fast-food cafes.</p><p>A waitress at the popular Horny Toad restaurant says: 'Stephenie and the boys come in here for burgers but she doesn't expect any special treatment. We just treat her the same as everyone else. She was Stephenie long before all this craziness started.</p><p>'She's not one to ever make a fuss. The only difference these days is she orders salad with her burger instead of fries. She's trying to watch her figure. She says the Press pictures always make her look fat.'</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/14/article-1227754-03F3BD20000005DC-350_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="Stephenie Meyer's house in Cave Creek, Arizona" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Writer's retreat: The house set along a dusty track in Cave Creek, Arizona, where Stephenie Meyer lives with her husband and three children</p><p>One place where Meyer is seen regularly is Cave Creek's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 'I know the family well,' said churchgoer Bob Hoover. 'Stephenie's husband is one of my best friends and her father is an elder here. We are a very close-knit community. The family have asked us to respect their privacy and that's what we do.'</p><p>According to another acquaintance, Meyer, as is customary for Mormons, gives the church a proportion of her earnings (believed to be ten per cent). She does not smoke and is teetotal.</p><p>The woman said: 'Stephenie is not the sort of person you could imagine living high on the hog. She doesn't even drink coffee.</p><p>'The Mormon Church is a power in this area and she is heavily involved in the church and obviously gives them a lot of her money. I don't think you will find anyone willing to go on the record about her.</p><p>'That is her secret - she wants to live an anonymous life and in Cave Creek she can. She takes her kids to school and goes to church. It sounds boring but that's the life she wants and loves.'</p><p>Meyer is the second of six children born to accountant Stephen Morgan and his wife Candace. It was Stephen who insisted on the unusual spelling of his daughter's first name and she has said it 'drove me mad because it's been spelled wrong all my life'.</p><p>She was educated in Scottsdale, Arizona, a 45-minute drive from Cave Creek. At Chaparral High School she is remembered as an unremarkable student.</p><p>'She was bright but not overly so,' says Conrad Davis, her former English teacher. 'Her writing was good but not outstanding. I remember her being very polite and fairly shy.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/15/article-1227754-07320362000005DC-796_468x324.jpg height=324 width=468 alt="British actor Robert Pattinson, US actress Kristen Stewart and actor Taylor Lautner pose for photographer as they present the film 'New Moon'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Frenzy: Fans of the Twilight books turned out in their hundreds to see the stars of the second film New Moon Taylor Lautner, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson<br></p><p>'She was from a Mormon family and those girls were always the best behaved in school. Stephenie was a good girl. We did the usual high-school studies - Shakespeare, American literature and some of the English writers such as Jane Austen.</p><p>'Stephenie was in my daughter's year but when she became famous both of us had to look her picture up to remember her clearly. She just blended in.'</p><p>After school, Stephenie read English at Brigham Young University, a Mormon-run college in Salt Lake City, Utah, before returning home to Arizona.</p><p>She met her husband - nicknamed Pancho - for the first time at a church event when she was aged just four. He has now quit his job as an auditor to be able to care for their sons while Stephenie writes her hugely successful books from an office at their home.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/15/article-1227754-05A0DE35000005DC-42_233x385.jpg height=385 width=233 alt="JK Rowling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Phenomenon: Like Harry Potter writer JK Rowling, Meyer's books speak directly to young people<br></p><p>One of Meyer's friends said: 'I don't think she ever had a proper boyfriend. When she came back from college she and Pancho got together and then the next thing I heard they were married. I think he's probably the only man she's been with.'<br></p><p>Meyer's lack of worldliness, ironically, is what has appealed to her largely teenage audience. Her books contain endless passages of unrequited lust and brooding angst.</p><p>In one of her rare public pronouncements on the subject, Stephenie said: 'My childhood was normal, sheltered normal. I was a late bloomer.</p><p>'When I was 16, holding hands was just - wow. I get some pressure to put a big sex scene in the books but you can go anywhere for graphic sex. It's harder to find a romance where they dwell on the hand-holding.<br></p><p>'When teenage girls give their heart to a show, an actor, a book or a boy, they do it totally.</p><p>'I had a long childhood. Everything in my life was so safe. I was very practical and I chose a nice boy, my husband.</p><p>'I think, for me, Twilight was dangerous. It was new ground. I was nowhere near as mature as Bella at her age and I would never have dated Edward.'</p><p>One reviewer describes her as 'the mistress of the erotics of abstinence'.</p><p>Author Stephen King also caused a flurry of publicity when he criticised what he perceived as Meyer's lack of literary talent.</p><p>He said: 'Both J. K. Rowling and Stephenie Meyer, they're speaking directly to young people. The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good.'</p><p>The criticism was greeted by Meyer with her preferred response: silence.</p><p>At her home in Cave Creek, no one answered the door when I visited on a midweek afternoon. Neighbours politely refused to comment on their town's most famous inhabitant.</p><p>One man in dusty cowboy boots said: 'Around here people value their privacy and keep themselves to themselves. The desert is where you come to get away from the world. Out here the only stars are in the sky.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhramdsgnV7s7CgpaGXncFuuMifnGaLpJq9qbHNopxmhZWusrN51qippZyjYq%2Bqs8aeqq1lkarBqbvRZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftwilight-life-stephenie-meyer-worlds-biggest-author-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./helena-bonham-carter-dismisses-cheating-allegations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./helena-bonham-carter-dismisses-cheating-allegations.html>'Absolute nonsense': Helena Bonham Carter speaks out on allegations Tim Burton has been unfaithful</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leilani-malia-mendoza.html>Married Life of Leilani Malia Mendoza and Brian!
